0,com.oristats.habitbull,Esther,"The main reason I chose the premium version of this app is being able to easily upload media with your journal entry. Great to document hikes in my case. I've been having issues with their Coach feature and have reached out to them twice. Concerning being able to join 2 different programs for AM & PM journaling for instance. And not having the Coach prompts appear in their web version, only on mobile. Beyond the Coach feature, it has been great for me. Pretty simple to use.",4
1,com.oristats.habitbull,Christine,"I've only had this a week and so far I love it!! Easy to use, nice visually, and I really appreciate that you can set what days of the week the goal can be accomplished and that you can choose how the goal will be reached (y/n, certain number, etc). You only get 5 goals with the free version and no back-up on the cloud but for now that works for me. There is a way to reorder your goals (when looking at them on the menu bar under My Order, press and hold goal, then drag), or you can see by score",5
2,com.oristats.habitbull,Kyra Weinzinger,"I have not paid for the full version, but I love how I can have 5 different goals and I can set very specific reminders/notifications throughout the day for each one. It has helped me not only to remember my goal, but also to track how good I am at actually achieving consistency in each goal. I've learned about my habit patterns from using this app. This is a great app for me!",5
3,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This app is literally the only thing that reminds me to take my meds. I love getting the notifications and tracking my progress so easily. However I just upgraded to the pro version specifically for the sync capability and...it does not work. -1 star. For $10, I would hope that the one feature I wanted would function like it's supposed to. I'm not happy about that at all. The home screen widget comes in handy so it's not a total loss but that alone is not worth the price. Please fix syncing!",4
4,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"If you delete the app or transfer phones, you will lose everything! All past progress is gone and you can not get it back. You also can never use that login info again. Just keep that in mind. Also if you set your habit/goal for example twice a week, you'll still get reminders everyday. No options to change it to only notify when goal needs to be completed.",3
5,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The one major short-coming of this app. (and most other ""habit trackers"") is that it does not have any option to calculate a total number (amount of hours, etc.) for a week or month--only a number of days or per day...That is a gaping deficit in these app's (with the exception of one or two with less desirable formats), as it is a far better way to track things like sleep which may fluctuate from.day to day. The other dismaying factor is that Habitbull doesn't seem to have any customer service, as I e-mailed numerous times about issues trying to upgrade (because it is a really helpful/useful application), and never got any response in about a year's time. :-\ Aside from the tabulation inadequacy discussed above--which I really hope they'll address/include that capability, it is a really helpful and useful app., and can be especially helpful for people with issues such as depression or ""OCD"" who may have difficulty keeping a handle on self-care and/or productivity (though, it could, also have the opposite effect, if people with ""OCD"" get too immersed in tracking things in their day-to-day :-S). In general, it is a good tool to have, though, and can help you make a lot of progress on things like household projects, etc., but I really do wish that they'd adjust it so that you can calculate a total for a duration of time longer than a day, and that they would also be conscientious about customer service/support and responding to/fielding correspondence and issues people encounter. ~*Kristin Star*",4
6,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Update: dropped 5 star rating to 1star. App will not sync. I have it on Android and iPad,and neither one of them will sync to the server. App store shows 8 months since any updates. Would not have paid for premium if I knew it wasn't going to be maintained. Original review: I wanted to make something like this myself, but they've already done a great job. I feel more obligated to the daily habits I'm trying to build, and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks.",1
7,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It's easy enough to use as it is, but for a fully paid app, the graphs are incredibly lackluster and basically useless. All you get is some minuscule, measly bar graphs which are tiny...and get this, they don't even label the metric you're tracking as they are displayed in the order in which your goal list is. So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month.",3
8,com.oristats.habitbull,Brendan Hickey,"Outstanding habit tracker app that is highly configurable to track daily, weekly, or any frequency of habits needed. Simple and clean user interface. Only thing I would change is adding the ability to change the order of habits. Right now, the habits appear on the screen in the order you entered them, and there does not appear to be a way to change the order",5
9,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Could be a great app except that like another user said, it does not sync between devices when the description claims that it can. That's a big letdown for me because when used any other of my devices, and when I switched phones, I couldn't sync the app up with my data or any habits I've been tracking, even though I have the premium account. When attempting to sync It always says that there is no internet connection, but there always is. So I can't give it a full 5/5 rating, otherwise I might.",3
10,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Great in a lot of ways, but a huge drawback is that you can't edit the start date or previous inactivated/activated dates for a habit. So, if you've been doing a habit for a few weeks before you add it to the program, you can't record those two weeks of success in the program. Or, if you intentionally stopped a habit for a time period, but didn't inactivate it during your chosen time off, your percentage is dragged down.",3
11,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Basic version works as described; just not what I need. The habits I want to improve require reminders at different times of day. And I'm personally not finding it an effective incentive, especially 'starting over' if missing one time. That's kind of a carrot AND stick approach. I'll stick to a simple checklist of what, & calendar/alarm clock to remind me when. Making this app's functions kind of ...basic and redundant? And since all apps use space... well, uninstalled. But the app works fine.",4
12,com.oristats.habitbull,T C,"The app is simple enough if all you need is a way to keep track of daily successes. The free version doesn't come with any of the motivational stuff, which is a bummer. I also wish there was a way to update a goal moving forward. For example, if I set a goal to drink 60 ounces of water a day for 2 months, but I later want to change it to 80 ounces a day, I either update the goal (which changes any previous days less than 80 to failures), or start a new goal which forfeits the streak.",4
13,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Great habit tracking app. The only things I think could be improved are: goal dates not automatically pushing back to match the day you edited a habit. And being able to edit how you want to track a habit if you change your mind. Maybe I missed something, but it seems like you have to recreate a habit in order to change how to keep track of it (ex. Yes/No or by keeping count with numbers). I highly recommend this tool though, it's a great place to start keeping track of habits!",5
14,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I downloaded a bunch of habit-tracking apps to test them out before New Year's. Habitbull seemed the most intuitive and straightforward. I really like the design (shows the streak on the calendar) and the fact that it nudges you if you don't check in during the day. There's even a community function where you can share the struggle with others doing the same thing. Great app.,5
15,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Nice configuration settings. Able to set most goals. One setting that I couldn't get to work for me was trying to get a goal for every other day. It seemed to that the goal needed to be completed every second day and comoleting it on off days didn't work. The UI is slightly un-intuitive as well. I don't think swiping up on a goal calendar should swap to another goal. It makes it hard to scroll down to the community form at the bottom if the app.,4
16,com.oristats.habitbull,No Nonsense,"Used it on & off for years. Motivational but not annoying like some. Nice design, various views (week, month, specific habit progress). Wide variety of goal options such as doing something x amount of times a week or every x day of the week or month. ALL the stats. You can set a date to achieve the goal (app recommends like 60 I think). Discussion boards. Other features as well, I just don't use them much. All in all, great app.",4
17,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It's helped me stay on track with habits I want to cultivate. I'm really data driven and thrive on external validation, so I like seeing graphs and the calendar fill up with my successful days. It works well for me. The app itself is good too. It hasn't crashed or done anything unexpected in the week I've used ii find logging mt. The only thing I wish I could do is go back and change what makes a day successful.",5
18,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This app is great, closest I've found to what I want! But I wish there was an option to add ""goals"" instead of just ""habits"" and give the goals a bit more options for their completion and reminders. Sure, I want to have the habit of eating healthy lunches, but I also want to record my goal of losing a certain amount of weight over a few months. :)",4
19,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"its a great app in general, just want a couple of tweaks that would make using it more streamlined. The biggest thing is I have goals that increase incrementally every day, I would love to have a way to have a yes or no that shows that incremental adjustment. Also, when inputting numerically set goals, I want to be able to just start typing the number and have it replace the default 0.0 without placing the cursor and backspacing to enter a result. Still, the interface is otherwise great!",3
20,com.oristats.habitbull,Missy K,"Nice app with really good features, some of which are customizable. I like the option to set a time/distance goal to consider my new habit a success. It works be nice but would like the goal to be set to what the goal is. Ex: 30min of yoga is the goal, yet it comes up as 0 for you to type in daily. It would be great for it so be at the goal so you only have to increase our decrease it.",4
21,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I didn't think this app was much at first, but I soon started to get into the swing of things I've been trying to get myself into for the longest time after installing. There's just something about that feeling of satisfaction when you fill in a circle for completing something. It tracks your streaks and your average progress. It also encourages you with cute quotes about being yourself and being the best you! Forming (or breaking) a habit can be done easily with Habit Bull!",5
22,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Regardless of my free version this app's intention is to help it's users increase positive habits and reduce negative habits. For someone like me who needs feedback, the percentage of success gives me an incentive and motivates me to keep the chain going. After using this app for almost two months I have been able to analyze and critique a few of the apps features. It would be interesting to know scientific statistics of the success of the app and if it is successful in what it is set out to do. In regards to the level of engagement I would say that the percentage strategy keeps me coming back to this app. For functionality, the free version runs smoothly, is clear, and easy to use. For aesthetics, it is simple and convenient however I do think that for some users it might be difficult to see due to size of buttons and font size. The information is a bit outdated and needs to be cited and should come from more credible sources. I do enjoy seeing that there is a discussion board for communication between users. From my subjective analysis this app's rating is a 4.1.",4
23,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I use it for keeping track of tasks after I complete them. I don't want a reminder of a task,I just need to keep track of it. This app allows me to disable reminders. Keeping track of them is as easy as checking off the day. It has the days circled based on how you schedule your tasks. The user experience is really easy. You can create multiple tasks (or habits to be), schedule them separately and keep track of them on one home page. It shows you stats etc to see your progress. Those for whom the reminders cause unnecessary stress (i.e. workout reminders), this app is better than calendar scheduling.",5
24,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This is a good app but the data analysis and visualization is fundamentally broken. The score and success percentage function in that they record the success values for the end of each day and then add that to the database. This means unfortunately that your success percentage never goes above your first day, when if you did the thing, you got 100%. As such, the visualizations are useless. A better solution would be to include rolling means of success percentage by x number of day intervals.",3
25,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This app is perfect for tracking my habits. It allows an effective level of depth without being overwhelming. I have been using this for several months and I love it. The only thing I would like to see would be ""Milestones"" to increase/decrease a habit without retroactively turning past week successes into failures. For example, increasing a workout habit from 2x/wk to 3x/wk.",5
26,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Excellent app. Does everything you want a habit tracking app to do. Only complaint is the app counts the current day in your progress with no option to change that. So it looks like you are less successful than you really have been on a daily activity done near the end of each day. For example, if I am tracking going to the gym after work everyday and have been successful for 2 weeks, the app will show me as less than 100% successful until I indicate today is successful. Need to fix that.",4
27,com.oristats.habitbull,Spartan 117 Bat,"Great for tracking your bad habits, making new good ones, and building a better lifestyle for yourself. Bought the full version for more habit tracking, which is great if you are dedicated, but $7.99 is a pretty hefty price for just 100 habits, some inspirational quotes, and a mediocre social system. It has helped me better myself over the past week of using it, so I'd highly recommend trying it, at least in the limited free version before buying the full version.",4
28,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The app is good to use overall. Except, as a number of other folks have said, it does not sync. And there is no response from the developer on this issue. Annoying to have paid for an app that claimed the sync feature, when it doesn't actually work. What that means is you lose all history every time you change the phone.",2
29,com.oristats.habitbull,Jared Fowkes,"Over priced, under developed app. The free version only allows for tracking five habits and the premium version is about $5 a month. The app lacks the polish off others available for less and feels more like a beta than a final product. In the end, I found a better app that's completely free, has more features, and a cleaner UI. My advice to the developer is to ditch the subscription model (or make it less expensive and annual).",3
30,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I really like how easy it is to use, that it displays your progress in a neat and easy-to-track way, and gives you options for how to measure your success (yes/no per day, #of days per week, days you want to succeed and days you can 'cheat', etc). It's pretty satisfying to tap the little circle for a thing I did and see it turn green and link up with other days! Would definitely recommend.",5
31,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This app has been great for me, especially to track daily goals I set for myself. it shows me the days I have succeeded, and the days Ive fallen short. I can see a history of my success and setup reminders to make sure I don't miss a daily goal. I've been using the app for a little over a month now and highly recommend it to anyone who has daily goals they want to rack and be successful with!",5
32,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I use this app to track various symptoms of my IBS. I also tried HabitHub and Loop, but only this app allowed me to track on a daily basis how many times a certain symptom occurred, and also set ""goals"" based on either ""no more than"" and ""no fewer than"" a given number of occurrences. I preferred the interface and graphs (I'd like to see a chart of raw numbers instead of just pass/fail) in some of the other apps, but from a purely functional standpoint this is the one to beat.",5
33,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,DO NOT BUY PREMIUM Version!! App stopped synching 7/27/2019 and is no longer supported. I got Premium to sync to new phone since I've been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking. $10 wasted! Very disappointing because basic version is great - simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits. Good visuals and the ability to make notes. Premium = tracking >5 habits and syncing across devices but no more! Would be 4 stars if still supported and worked.,2
34,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Can only track 5 habits, but there are discussion forums. Most of the forums have no activity going on, but there are still a few users to talk to. Often times the app no longer syncs me to them, just like right now. The quotes have been stuck, too. Developers no longer support this app. Do not buy the premium version, as you will NOT be able to sync across devices. There are no more updates or customer support. This could have been the absolute best habit tracking app. So much wasted potential.",3
35,com.oristats.habitbull,Stacy Nelson,"I've owned and used this app for years. I really liked it. I had to uninstall because of storage space priorities. Now that I've got more available space in my phone, I've reinstalled. Unfortunately, it keeps crashing. I open it, and it instantly closes. Then I have to open it again. And if I leave it to go to Home and another app, then go to pull it up again, it crashes. I've done all the basic trouble shooting. Didn't help. Incredibly disappointed.",1
36,com.oristats.habitbull,Luke,I love this app for easily tracking my habits to work towards personal goals. There's only two things that could make this app better: being able to disable decimals on specific habits (to count full numbers would be great as you do sets of a workout and make updating the count easier) and not losing the progress of a goal if you change the specifications to meet it (like going from doing 10 to 20 pushups a day and not losing the streak from before the change was made).,4
37,com.oristats.habitbull,Mandy Rogers,"Please fix the widget! I want to check items off here. It's good for what I needed. Simple. Good stats. Like the for color coding. Don't really need the chats on topics, I don't look at or use that. I wanted more than 5 items on my list and the widget for easy tracking on my home screen. The widget only works sporadically to check off an item, that's annoying considering I paid the one time fee. Apparently it's known issue, should've read more reviews and maybe not purchased.",3
38,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Easy to set up and daily tracking is very simple. Visual display is great. If a habit is set for every other day, or with some other gap in between, the app shows a chain with open circles rather than solidly-colored circles. Likewise, if the goal is a specific number of minutes or repetitions, it color-codes the entry differently depending on whether you met or did fewer reps than the goal. Only using the free app for now but plan to upgrade.",5
39,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Absolutely love this app. 4 out of 5 for two reasons. One, navigation, I think swiping between habits rather than scrolling would be a better interphase and also more intuitive. Scrolling habits only goes one direction, swiping could go both, as long as you're off the calendar. Two, the free version only can track five habits. I'll probably buy the app for full access, because this truly is a good app. However just a few more, say 10 instead of 5 in the free version would've been appreciated.",4
40,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Sync DOES NOT work! I've tried multiple times to get it to work and my internet connection is just fine. Had to switch phones when my old phone died and can't get my old data back on the app because sync doesn't work. Also no way to import data. Great app if the feature worked or could import data, but rendered useless because of this. So if I switch phones or have to reset to factory standards, I lose everything. Paid quite a bit for this app just for this feature alone, but it DOES NOT work.",1
41,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I've tested dozens of habit and routine tracking apps. The clean layout, useful widgets, and versatility of this one puts it above the rest. Even without premium, it is highly functional. Furthermore, premium is a one-time purchase rather then a monthly/annual fee, which was a deciding factor for me.",5
42,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Very helpful to be mindful of areas you want to change and feels rewarding as you see streaks of success. It is easy to use. It's design allows you to take baby steps towards more ambitious goals. Also setup manages your goals so they are realistically obtainable. Reminders setup is very flexible so notifications are useful and welcome. Great user friendly design which is highly customizable,5
43,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It is such a great app to help you manage your time! I really like the fact that it can set the reminder time in a very specific way, it is perfect for people who have a different schedule everyday. One thing to point out will be the choice of the habit. Although you can type it yourself, wont really affect anything, I would like to have more type of habit to choose except for clicking ""other"". Also, it is sad that you need to pay for back up, but it is understandable.",4
44,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I really like this app and find it useful for keeping me on track. Simple but effective. I used the free version for almost 2 years. At the end of the first year it reset and I lost all of my history. So before the end of the second year I bought the premium version and promptly lost all of my history again. I contacted support to see if they could help and got no response at all. I still recommend it for tracking your habits but don't expect to keep the info long term or get help if you need it,3
45,com.oristats.habitbull,Calista,"Very good for starting small. I remember downloading a similar app without a limit and I was very quickly overwhelmed by the number of goals I set for myself. I like only being able to track 5, it motivates me to reach those goals as soon as I can so I can set and work towards setting more. I also love the motivational quotes under the ""All Habits"" section.",5
46,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,The tracker has a clean interface and it's simple to set up habits. I've only experienced one glitch: sometimes when you're looking at the calendar view of a habit the heading won't show up. If I could improve the app I would make the habit description show up in the habit calendar page. Right now you have to click on the habit name to view the description. I would also make an option to include skip days so if you need to skip a habit it doesn't count against your streak progress.,4
47,com.oristats.habitbull,Marcos Avila,"I've used this app on iPhone before. I had at least 2 years worth of habits tracked. I recently switched to android and tried logging in but it keeps telling me something went wrong and to try again in a bit. I've uninstalled the app several times but it won't change anything. I tried registering a new account and it keeps kicking me back to the first login screen. I can't select the ""forgot password"" option either. I really hope this can be resolved soon.",1
48,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Great habit tracking tool. The widget on the home screen is a great size so I can see quickly how well I'm doing, and the options at set up are thorough. I'm tracking all sorts of things and it's easy to see how I'm doing. Highly recommended.

49,com.oristats.habitbull,Arabela Y,"Excellent app. Simple but extremely useful, has absolutely improved my life and held me accountable to keeping my habits--this app is the reason I was able to learn a foreign language, start reading consistently again, and cut social media out of my life.

Definitely get this app if you are looking to change something in your life!",5

Widgets no longer work unless you open the app, and sometimes even then you have to take an action or two within the app. The usual fixes don't work: The app doesn't even support logging out, anymore. The usual uninstall/reinstall didn't work.",2
51,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Well, like anything this app is only as useful as you're willing to let it be.  BUT, if you are committed to either making or breaking (or both!) any habit you can think of, then this little jewel of an app can help you do that.  The idea of ""streaks"" may seem trivial to some, but we all crave this at some level because it clearly marks out your accomplishments in a tangible way.  When you see you have X days of success, you are that much more likely to overcome the impediments you may face.  What's more, this program is highly flexible in the ways you can track any given habit.  I have yet to find a habit and pattern I couldn't set up.  The app is free, although I paid for the premium version because 1) I HATE ads and 2) I liked the flexibility of data export, so just try it and you may find that it changes your life for the better.",5

I have found myself being better about some of the tasks I out to myself, which I can attribute to this app's ease of use.

53,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"10/10 Great app! Let's you keep track of goals and habits daily. It's highly customizable and will send you notifications to remind you of stuff, if you want. Also I really like the message boards, I find them really inspirational. Also, I've been using this app for several months, and it's never asked me to pay anything. And there aren't any ads either. I know that there's a premium version in one of the side menus, but I'm not sure what it does because it already gives you everything you want.",5
54,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Liked the setup so much that I quickly became a premium user. The widget alone is worth it. I love the flexibility the app allows in specifying when I can work on developing a habit.

56,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Near perfect. Considering you only really need a piece of paper on the wall or a calendar to track habits. It does that and more with a clean UI.

57,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I have used several habit tracking apps and this one is the best. It is easy to use and I like the way it gives my percentage success rate and my streaks.

I'm giving up on this app, and suggest you do too. ""I've used this for a couple of years.

I'd like the font to be more bold as it's kind of hard to see. 2. The cost for the premium version is WAY TOO HIGH -_- I wouldn't spend 320 per month on a habit app. I don't spend that much even on video streaming apps.

Only one remark from me: if I change the number of repetitions per week of an activity, it changes the whole statistics (also for the previous period).

Seeing the whole month with the colour indicators for achieved/didnt achieve for each day is helpful as it's easy to gauge how successful you were that month compared to other months. The motivating messages when you accomplish your goal consistently for a period is a really nice touch!,5

User interface aspects like fonts and some screens like the first ""create habit"" screen seem a little heterogeneous when compared to the rest of the app; in other words, they seem displaced, out of vibe.

220,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,This is a brilliant app for tracking habits.

4910,com.oristats.habitbull,BlueSky Nomad,"The app hasn't been updated for over a year, the link for the motivational images is broken, can't sync my account, the user forum is no longer there... I have a premium account and previously give 5 stars for the app but the developer really needs to update it and keep it functional.",2
4911,com.oristats.habitbull,P Harris,"I had some issues logging in because the email address was case sensitive- which is nonsensical. But once I fixed that and the issues installing in 3 devices after purchasing premium, I've had a good time with the app. The widgets are beautiful and easy to use. Without any gamificación, I sometimes lose focus, but wanting to see a streak in the widget helps a lot.",4
4912,com.oristats.habitbull,Rebi Cimpean,"hello, your app is wonderful and i will buy it if i can organize my habits according to the topic, like Health, Study, etc. Thank you! Edit:I have removed since then two stars since I experience a problem with the app and I haven't received any answer from the dev, even though I sent them an email. It's about the picture not being displayed at all in the app, and it looks less beautiful like that.",2
4913,com.oristats.habitbull,Dani V,"Has helped me tremendously develop new habits. UI is perfect! The app and widgets allow quick and easy habit tracking. Counting habits are useful, but it would be great to be able to see near misses to track improvement better. Major con: This the worst app I've ever seen regarding logging into a new device, and by far! Literally took me days last time. Don't use the Facebook login, it seems broken. PS: I preferred the Habit Bull name and logo so much better I never updated the app since.",4
4914,com.oristats.habitbull,Debra Hammett,"Very simple app for tracking habits. Get 5 habits for free. Need any tech support? Well, let's hope not because they aren't very helpful. They don't ask questions or try to understand what you're experiencing. They want to give the easiest answer possible and they don't really care if that actually resolves the problem. Maybe they are still working on my issue, I don't know, because I haven't heard an update since I told them all their suggestions don't apply to my situation-with screen shots.",3
4915,com.oristats.habitbull,Karen Manahan-Singson,"My username disappeared, and I can't bring it back nor type in a new one; an error message regarding my Internet (which is working just fine) just keeps appearing instead. The forum and inspirational messages haven't been working in forever either. It's been a year since the last update, it seems, and I'm worried about my data being synced or not 😱😭 UPDATE: Seems like it's fixed now 🙌 – except for the inspirational messages 😕",4
4916,com.oristats.habitbull,Mayank Dhuria,The images of quotes are not loading. Please fix this. And have you guys removed the discussion forums because they are too not functioning properly. Thanks. The app is great.,5
4917,com.oristats.habitbull,Roni h,"Switched phone and now the app won't recognize my account or user, even though I have a premium account. Lost 5 years of data and they won't answer any of my emails. ****Problem was fixed.",1
4918,com.oristats.habitbull,Zack Wussow,"I wish it had better widgets. The app functionality is good, but the widget selection is limited and the widget tends to freeze all the time so it's not that useful anyway.",3
4919,com.oristats.habitbull,Juan Pablo Vargas,Excelente para tener un registro de habitos. Un tiempo se me congelaron las imagenes motivacionalea. Pero luego ya se volvieron a normalizar. Es genial sin embargo siento que le falto algo mas de interactividad,4
4920,com.oristats.habitbull,Alexandre Cucatti,"Looks the app is abandonedly. The motivational photo is missing, the forum is not working, there are bugs worthy of attention and not any update recently",1
4921,com.oristats.habitbull,Str8 Gigachad,Would be great to track more than 5 habits but not a big deal. Notifications don't work either so it's more difficult to start a habit using this apo,3
4922,com.oristats.habitbull,Shabaab Kamal,"AVOID. This was my favorite habit tracker, but the developer no longer supports the app, so I lost access to my premium version when I switched phones. Zero support when you email them. Pick another app.",1
4923,com.oristats.habitbull,Dylan,"The app is great, however, the widgets are broken. Having functional widgets is extremely important for reducing the friction of inputing habit streaks. This has been an issue for a long time.",3
4924,com.oristats.habitbull,Zachery Izer-Gibson,"It is breaking and needs an update. If that happens, I would recommend. As it is, I would stay away.",5
4925,com.oristats.habitbull,nick kirby,"Used it for years, then they reduced functionality and limited the habits to 3, with an expensive premium version. There arent new business costs, this is a lazy cash grab",2

Very clean and easy to navigate interface, useful statistics and clear feedback on both the streak and the overall trend and percentage. I love the easy way to switch between weekly and monthly view. One suggestion would be to include a colored bar for each habit where the colors are based on the daily success and failures. I saw this in one of the better iphone habit apps.

5353,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"So it looks like I was mistaken about what happened to Habit Tracker. It's still true that back at the beginning of 2018 I lost access to premium status and emails weren't being answered. But it seems like development hasn't stopped and whatever went wrong back then is fixed now. I emailed support and got a reply within minutes (on a Friday afternoon at 4:15 EDT). Within a couple of hours, my premium access was restored and HabitTracker now works well again.   I've tried a bunch of other similar apps, and was starting to learn Flutter so I could just write my own replacement. I'm glad that HT is back and I don't have to go there.  -----------------------------------------------  I think the developer sold the program to a company that buys successful apps, but stops development and does no support. Check out the reviews of their other apps. This program will probably never be fixed.  Since the January update I don't have premium. My emails don't get answered and now habit tracker claims it hasn't any record of my email address. It was a good program until a month ago.",5

review: I ended up paying for the full version. I can keep track of habits 
and assign days of the week. It's simple to track and I get reminders at

speaking, so I ignored the email and decided to try to register one more

checkmarks don't stand out. The default circles option just isn't very 
intuitive to me, I would much rather have usable checkmarks instead (hint, 
get rid of the dang circles, or at least make then faint and barely 
noticeable).. And what the heck is the difference between a blank circle 
and a red/orange (or whatever that actual color is). Also, its WAY too easy 
to accidentally check/uncheck things. Pressing and holding for couple 
seconds would be a much better option. Also there's no support for tablet 
PORTRAIT mode, so if your tablet is 10"" or larger, again all you see is a 
bunch of ENORMOUS circles on your screen - very hard to see a 
weekly/monthly overview with those huge circles. They could've at least 
expand the view instead of stretching it. Also, why the heck is my email 
address case sensitive???? I can't even log in unless I input 3 capital 
letters in my email address.. I see some folks were talking about not being 
able to log in - this is why, because somehow their system is setup so you

I even uninstalled and reinstalled and it's still not syncing. PLEASE RESOOND.   I love this app. I love how customizable it is and that it syncs across devices.

7062,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Unlike other people I was able to sign in on a new phone and get upgrade to premium very easily. My problem is notifications didn't work on my old phone and now they don't work on my new phone.

I realised that I needed more trackers than five and yes I agree that you don't NEED more than 5 and you don't NEED too pay for this app if you dont think it's worth it. But I do think it's good for me.  I see in the comments that alot of people complain and have problems with the server and that they dont received the premium features after paying.  I upgraded my app around 3 days ago and I received everything and didn't had any problems.  For me its great to track EVERYTHING, to see my results and that there are not only hard capable habits (like for example dieting, studying ect.) on the list but also easy once I want to make a habit out of them (like for example clean daily for 10 min, sorting a corner of your room ect.) Also having easier habits make you feel a bit better. Checking at least one box a day you'll  feel like you really can achieve your goals. I had a habit tracker in my Bullet journal and that isn't bad aswell.

I set the app to remind me 4 times a day to keep my back straight. Only after a few days I felt the change. My back started hurting a bit from it, but my posture improved. After about a month I didn't need the reminder as my back would stay straight without me thinking about it. It's amazing! I use the app also to remind me to meditate, write in my journal, and do something new every day. Big thank you to the developers! :)",5

7558,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Amazing app! I love the simplicity of its setup. I installed it a week ago and a few hours later got the paid version. It's not that I had more habits to track but to contribute to the developer as it's a really amazing!,5

7652,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"By far the best app on the market for habit tracking (I've tried several of them). After a little back and forth to get premium working, it was certainly worth the wait.  [Original Review] I wish I could leave 5 stars...

7670,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Pretty good with a decent amount of flexibility, but I'd like to be able to do more combinations. Specifically, you can set a target on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, but not mixed. Hard to explain, but for example, I can set a target of 5k steps per day, but I can't set a target of 35k steps per week that would add up across seven days. I can only say hit my daily target however many days per week. Other than that it's easy to use, but I find the daily reminders a little annoying.",4
7671,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Paid for premium - got a new phone and it didn't allow me to access premium. Got another new phone a year later and now it won't even let me open the app due to a ""database mismatch"" have emailed multiple  times with no reply. Very disappointed about the absolute lack of customer swrvice",1
7672,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Like the previous negative reviews, I have yet to receive any response from the customer service after purchasing the premium version, and yet still cannot add more than 5 habits on my account.  The app is very well designed, and very effective, but their customer service responsiveness need to improve.",1
7673,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"6 months later I switched to a new phone, I have an account, I have a receipt for the paid premium version BUT it will not transfer the version, wants me to buy it again.  I've tried emailing several times with no response whatsoever from Habitbull.  I'm dropping my rating.  It's great for the free version but be aware if you pay for the premium and need to change phones you have to buy it all over again and NONE of your data will transfer. <<So far so good. Love the reminders, works so much better than calendar or the to do list apps I had tried.>>",2
7674,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Its okay, but if you purchase premium you better sure you want it. There is no way to get a refund if you change your mind even one second after purchase. I can't support that.   I like that you can leave a note on a habit but you can't leave a note on a day. Its not very flexible either. For example, if you want to track your weight, you can't just track it. You have to create a ""goal"" and timeline for a habit of weight.   If you want to track individual habits and you don't want to see any of them tracked together, this will be a fine app for you.",1
7675,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Awesome habit tracker! The feedback you get from imputing your data is really helpful when you look back at the calendar and see your long-term progress. Really helps you get better at whatever your attempting to improve. Also having the app be your reminder for your daily habits helps a lot. The app is easy to use and looks good so definitely worth a try.,5
7676,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The premium version of the HabitBull HabitTracker is great...until you get a new phone or have to reformat your phone. You are unable to install the premium app again and the developer won't respond to emails. So, I basically wasted my $4.99 (the price when I purchased it) for an app that I cannot install.  Google Play customer support says they cannot refund me since I purchased it a year ago.   Needless to say, I'm aggravated and disappointed at the customer service all around. How can an app still be available for purchase when it violates the terms stated in that app that it's a lifetime purchase plus violates Google's terms that the developer needs to support the app.   It's sad since it was a good app when I could use it. Stay away from it unless you want to lose your money.",1
7677,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I loved this app, but like many others, I have been unable to access my premium account after reinstalling. Absolutely no response from the developer despite emailing as directed in the help info. I'd even be happy to repurchase it, but there's no option to do so because the app can recognize that I've purchased it before! This was such a good app, would absolutely be 5 stars if I could actually use it again.",1
7678,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Love the visual display and ease of entering habits and setting daily updates. Only request would be the ability to change method of habit completion after habit has already been created. For example if a habit requires an input of a certain number or higher in order to succeed for a day but I want to change it to a simple button pass/fail I have to delete the habit and write it again,4
7679,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I used it for a while but started using a different app due to its ""sticky reminders"" because I just snoozed these or dismissed them sometimes. Please consider sticky reminders so that way it's less likely that a habit is dismissed and forgotten about. It may make a huge difference.",4
7680,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The app is okay but do not buy the premium. I bought the premium and never received it, I followed the instructions on the FAQ portion of their website and still never got it to work. I tried to contact the developer twice about it and yet heard nothing back. Giving a 2 star since the app works but they have terrible customer service and will steal your money.",2
7681,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,It's been very helpful so far (2 months in).  I'm very slowly changing my habits.  I like seeing the stats and streaks I've done per habit.  I only have an alert for 1 habit.  Not annoying.  I'm making slow progress but I can see that I am making improvements... without the app I wouldn't have an accurate idea of my progress.  I like that you don't have to make it a daily task to still get a streak going (e.g. vegetarian once a week).,5
7682,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I absolutely love this app! It's just the thing I was looking for. I downloaded several of the highest rated habit tracking apps, test drove all of them and ended up chosing this one :)  The only additional thing I would like for it to have that it is missing is ability/option to upload and set rewards.",5
7683,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Really helped me to realize the focus and discipline and dedication it takes to accomplish goals, and create habits which become a part of your life. This app has helped me change my life. It shows me percentages of how i am doing and it's fun like your own personal video game but its about you and healthy habits. Its empowering, challenging, exciting and makes you feel proud of yourself when you do succeed. It also motivates you by keeping track of what you need to work on. Gives you a visual which is very helpful.",5
7684,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It's a good app, exept - it doesn't remind me at all. The notifications don't make a sound in silent mode (and I chose a sound in the app settings) I purchased pro, but I just ignore those notifications because they're not invasive. If you do something about it, I'll come back.",1
7685,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I have tried at least 20 of this type of app and this is the best one of them all. Easy to use with great features and took no time to set-up and learn. I am 51 and very impatient especially with apps and todays technology. Keeps me motivated and on course. Great job app Dudes ... or Dudette's .... lol ...,5
7686,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Great little app.   I liked it so much I wanted to go premium.   And that's why I haven't given it 5 stars...  It seems to glitch out in payments for premium.   In payment the value is shown in £ not NZD and the payment doesn't go through.   It works well enough in basic mode though so its not the end of the world.,4
7687,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,This is working better than I thought it would. The reminders are great and being able to track things quickly and easily in the calendar really helps you see your progress. All surprisingly motivating. You can design your goal to be as challenging or simple as you like and you can add notes. Better than a diary or journal.,4
7688,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I wanted to try out a habit tracker and Habitbull seemed a reasonable choice - not as feature rich as the iOS products, but all the basic features were there.  I paid for the premium version to unlock more than 5 habits, then registered the app for premium updates.  That was a mistake - the app immediately syncs your data to the company's servers, which I did not want.  Worst still, you have no option not to sync if you're logged on, and (once you've registered) you're locked out of the app if you log out.  This is too dictatorial for my liking - my private data is my private data, so the app is uninstalled.",1
7689,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This is the right one for me. Does everything it should, reliably. Simple to use and an aesthetic UI. Even has a fairly active and uber supportive community that I didn't think I'd care about but is very nice.  After trying 4 or 5 I'll say this is the clear winner. DL it. Use it. Change your life.",5
7690,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I have a suggestion. Why not keep the failed days more distinguishable from the successful days? Currently there's barely any difference between the two and it doesn't really stand out. If you changed the failed days to ""X""s or something they'd be more noticable and bad looking, which might make us avoid it more. The darker circle isn't as bad to look at so breaking a streak doesnt stand out as much and doesn't have enough of an impact.",3
7691,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Really like the app. Purchased the premium version after a couple of months. It works fine with my Note 5. I was wondering if you could create some kind of gallery type feature so that people can perhaps upload there own motivational images or upload images they have taken of themselves in case they wanted to track there progress if there trying to get rid of body fat or put on some muscle. And then the app can send the image thru the notifcations feature just to remind the user for motivational purposes. Just some suggestions.,4
7692,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This app is really helpful; however the downside of it is the support! I haven't heard from them for days. Nothing. While the app functions as it's intended, the lack of support makes it unreliable, for it may imply discontinuance of the product: no further improvements being made.",2
7693,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"You have to actually open the app to track your habits. No push notifications. That's a little too proactive for someone trying to break bad habits. Also, you get to track up to 5 habits for free. Between the unhealthy ones I want to quit and the healthy ones I want to make, 5 isn't nearly enough.",2
7694,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,If it was possible for me I would have given a noble prize to the developers and the product owner of this app for developing and conceptualizing this wonderful app with its gorgeous UI and UX. I have been an Android and iPhone app developer myself for a few years and I know how challenging it is to roll out an app like this. The app works so smoothly that the users are oblivious to how much of a discussions and brainstorming has gone into it. It looks like a beautiful doll and works smoothly like butter. Absolutely enjoy using it and it is the only app I see as soon as i wake up and just before going to sleep.,5
7695,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Darn good app with a few suboptimal design decisions - settings gear at the top of the pop instead of the bottom would be easier to access, I'd like folders for habits. Under the hood, the rest is great - runs smoothly and every habit completely customizable.",4
7696,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I am using this app daily and it really helps me have an overview of the habits that are working for me. A few changes, such as Saturday as first day of the week, categories of habits, and a better material design would get 5 stars from me.",4
7697,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Can't even get past the account set up part...it just spins forever and never goes anywhere. Too bad, I was excited about using it. It's not the first app to not work right on a pixel though.",1
7698,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Checked out many goal tracking apps but this one stood out from the rest thanks to it's sleek design, flawless performance, and great array of key features. As a rule, I don't pay for apps but this one was completely worth it. To the developers.. an option to display a message upon failing a goal would make this app perfect in my opinion. Something along the lines of, ""why do you think you failed to complete __ today?"" or, ""what can you do tomorrow to ensure completion of this task?""  Thanks for the awesome app!",5

But after I got purchase receipt, I still could not add more than 5 habits and the ""Get premium "" option is still there. Please help solve this. Thanks!",3
8529,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"good date-based habit tracking app. set apart from other habit tracking apps by its online storage and possibility to use the app on multple devices. Why the ""sync"" has to be called manually to update data entered on another device is beyond me though. It really should sync automatically on each start!",4
8530,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Amazing app to track progress on almost anything I do. I use it to track my dairy free days and the days when I read books. Very simple and useful.,5
8531,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Brilliant app. So easy to use and makes things clear and really gives me achievable goals.,5
8532,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I have been looking for something similar to brain buddy on ios and this app is even better. Tracking multiple events, timely reminders, comments & journal section have been my favorites. I want to congratulate the team on this design and want to encourage them for future designs.  Good job guys!",5
8533,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I like the app and the design however I am very much disappointed with the restricted features of being a free user. You even wouldn't allow us to use widgets.,2
8534,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Would be great to be able to set the interval of when you press the + or - habit to log in times; great app, so easy track my habits and gives me an incentive to keep going 👌",5
8535,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,This is a great app that has made a big difference to my life already. Super fun to track habits and motivates me to keep up the good work. Simple clean and colourful look makes it a joy to look at.,4
8536,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Awesome app. Only thing missing is someone keeping my habbits for me 😂,5
8537,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It's super easy to use, and I liked that I could record the days prior to using this particular app.",5
8538,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Very nice and minimalist app. It would be 5 stars if they allow tracking more then 5 habits.,4

8546,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Nice app !! Helpful for forming a new habit. Will highly recommend it.,5
8547,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I like this app... but you can only create only 5 habits on free version?! Come on guys you could at least make 10. And can't get premium as the button doesn't work.,3
8548,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Need to absolute precise when set up. Too rigid.,4

8557,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This is the best app of its kind I've seen, and I've been looking for a while. It's super simple, so it doesn't feel like a chore to update it, the design is  a perfect mix of style (especially the dark theme) and functionality.  I recommend it to anyone who's been lookin for a way to finally make those habits last",5
8558,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Love the interface and idea, however I would like the option for more persistent notifications, or at least more reminders. Just a simple ping in the notification bar every day isn't enough for me. I'd love the ability to set an alarm like reminder, possibly for each habit, and maybe even how many reminders per day. I still went and bought the full version, love the app itself, but I feel like I could be getting a lot more out of it, especially for the price.",2
8559,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This is a great app and I am happy to have paid to support its development. I would like to suggest one feature: many different people use this app and they have very different daily schedules. In particular, our ""day"" might not necessarily end at 23:59 (or 11:59pm). It would be great if we could specify at what hour the day should ""roll over"" to the next day. E.g., when I finish accomplishing some habits it is often past midnight and the widget has already moved on to the next day. Would be great to be able to define when that happens.",5
8560,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Easy to use. I downloaded this for free and have 5 goals at the moment. Started as daily then went to 5 days per week. Once I have good streaks will bump them up by one day per week so I only miss once max.,5
8561,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,It was great while it worked. I changed phone and was never able to activate premium. I have written to several different email addresses to address the issue with the developers without ever any acknowledgement. So beware when they say that your premium is good FOREVER,2
8562,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Best in this category. Gives flexible recurrence settings and any other feature I was looking for for free. Bought premium just to support devs and track way more habits. Widgets do save time.,5
8563,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Good app. Found a security issue - I've set up pin protection. However if I enter app through app notification, it let's me login without prompting me to enter my pin.",4

8565,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Fantastic app. So many options. A little pushy on the reminders but that is the point😉. This app helped me track my goal of quitting smoking and now I have been smoke free for a year 😀,4
8566,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,This app is perfect for my need. I found that I start sticking to the habits that I want to cultivate after about day 2 or at least be more aware of those habits.,5
8567,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,It's not workin. I been used for 5 months. And suddenly stopped working. I already reset the phone and the application as nothing...,1
8568,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I really prefer this app. I used to just make to do lists but setting up this app with alerts actually helps me do better at doing these things.,4

8570,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I like this app. It's great for accountability and motivation! Does it need a little work? Yes. Does it fulfill it's purpose? Yes. For example, the alerts sometimes work, sometimes don't. For me, this is not a deal breaker, just something I look forward to improving as they fix bugs and make it better. I also wish they had a widget on the free version. Overall it's easy to use, super customizable, and has personality!",5
8571,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I tried this app along with several others to see which one I like the best in this by far is exactly what I wanted. Keeps me on my game.,5
8572,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The app is fantastic and the premium is worth the money, in my opinion. Just be careful as the support is very slow and if something happens you may be waiting days for a response.",5
8573,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Easy to use! I downloaded this and another habit tracker at the same time. The other was slicker and had more bells and whistles but I ended up deleting it and paying for the professional version of this. It's easy to add habits and you have a choice in how you set them up and categorize them. It's very satisfying to check off my habits and its really keeping me on track.,5
8574,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Great app! I really like the fact that it features a community of people who have similar goals. It's really motivating and I just never want to see that streak broken.,4
8575,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,UI could be cleaner but simple enough to use.  It would be nice to be able to tally weekly or monthly quotas for certain goals (i.e. run atleast 10 miles a week.),4
8576,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I finally got around to installing the app again, after a phone switch. I had installed the app for a while without signing in, and to get to the login screen I had to completely uninstall the app, including the reinstall 24 hour file just for good measure, and then powered off, restarted, and reinstalled the app.",5
8577,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"App realizzata davvero bene, con ottimi e abbondanti contenuti, personalmente adoro oltre alle normali funzioni la presenza del forum e di inspirational/motivational quotes.

8691,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I've been using the free version of this app for a few weeks and I think it's great.

I was so amazed that I purchased a premium plan to sync between devices. I then realised that there was a typo in my email address and sent an email to get it corrected. No answer. I resent an email 1 week later and still no answer. This app deserves a 5 star rating if the support was there.

I got premium, and it worked fine until I got a new phone.  FAQ says wiping or transferring between phones can result in a lock out, and to please send an email to support.  I sent four over the course of two weeks, with no response at all.  So, here's my review.  If this 'bug' is ever fixed, or if they respond in a timely fashion, great.

8697,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Problems with Android update. I'm a premium user. The app itself seems great. Attractive, easy to use. But with the recent update it will crash whenever I export a file. Reinstalling the app meant I l lost the premium. That was reinstated after contacting customer service. However, they won't respond to my questions about the crashing. If you don't need to export, this is a good app. If you do, you this one will just crash. Don't expect customer service to get back to you.",3
8698,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,This is a great visual to get in your head how much of your goal you are reaching. I love that it has a calendar view and charts. But I can be a nerd that way. You get up to 5 goals before you need to pay to upgrade. I think this is the best app I have found so far. But there is always room for improvement.,4

The transition process was not terribly smooth (not a lot of tools for these sorts of transitions, who knew?), but after I was able to get up and running and all my data moved over, the couple extra features were worth the pain.  Additionally, the support really takes care of their users. I originally had an issue with signing in. After writing an email to the support email, Thomas (the gentleman who helped me) was able to get everything ironed out in short order.",5
8702,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Best app for tracking habbits and I tried a few. So important to monitor your past. Make a list of things which should be achieved and avoided in a day. Watch your progress and gain motivation. Muhasaba : You only move forward when you start looking back.,5

8709,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I love this habit tracker because I'm able to set different  ways to monitor my habits e.g everyday; some days of the week etc. My only issue is the reminder doesn't pop up on my screen so it's easy to forget which habit or the tracker entirely.

I've used this app since 2014 and purchased premium and it's helped me kick a nasty addiction... i owe a lot to the app but now can't use it :( please sort it devs!!

They change constantly, and are funny and creative.

8714,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Awesome app, has really helped me add some positive habits to my life! One additional feature: it would be nice to be able to add an exception to a day so it doesn't break your streak. Ex. Habit is to arrive 15 minutes early to work, set to only require M-F. Working on weekends and being early allows me to add to my streak, but choosing to not do so does not break my streak. But if there is a national holiday on a weekday and I don't go to work, I don't want my streak to break and I don't want to just say I did accomplish the habit since I didn't actually do it. Hence, allow the ability to ""omit"" a day from the requirement. Thanks!",4

I tried several other ""habit maker"" apps before coming across HabitBull. None could remotely compare. As a professional developer myself, I can hardly think of ANY way I could improve this app. And that's just so that for me.

9387,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I love this app and it's helping me to be much more productive and break bad habits.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I feel it should be more customizable.  For example, we should be able to designate days off for holidays or vacation.  Also, why do I have to specify how many pages I have read or how many hours I have worked if I set a time for reading and number of Pomodoros.",4
9388,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It's biggest limitation is the rigid number entry or yes/no function. If you want to track your weight every few days for instance you'll have to make a comment for the day to record your actual weight. -Not terrible, the app could just use some UI tweaks. Other than that free version limits you to 5 items to track so download this app if you have a just a few core goals you're trying to accomplish for the year.",4

I only manged to get reset password email if I am using this app from iOS. This little detail shown how badly Habitbull have maintained for Android.)",1
9390,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I like how easy to use it is, and how at a glance i can see how ive been performing in a habit, or across all my habits. Love the desktop widget for androids. Keeps me focussed during the day without going into the app. Would love to see the addition of goals or one shot tasks with due dates as well.",4
9391,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Notification actions are either delayed in submitting response or doesn't log at all, thus creating redundant notifies. Also, Android Wear integration is lacking so responding to a notification doesn't mark the user choice in the app. Location based reminders would be nice and/or Tasker integration would be awesome! Keep up the good work though",3
9392,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I am really glad I finally made the commitment to give this a go.  I thought I was completing specific tasks towards goals on a daily basis; however, I was not doing this as often as I led myself to believe. Having to rate myself daily as actually completing the task or not has been incredibly eye opening.  Getting the daily reminder to indicate if I worked toward the goal is extremely helpful. It is allowing me to prioritize tasks to make sure I work towards those goals daily. It really is an amazing tool!",5
9393,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The application has an extremely poor user interface. Navigating the app is very frustrating.

Visual Learners out there and Structure driven or competitive people will fall in love with this app. You can track habits by ""yes or no"" (which is quick and easy) or by putting in a number of how many times you've done something  (how many miles you ran, pages read, etc) Great for beating old records or just tracking what days I tend to skip so I can fix it! Most helpful app I've bought, hands down.",5

9399,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Just a couple of suggestions. Display the current value on the reminder notification.

9400,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This app is perfect for visually seeing the progress I've made with developing my useful habits. There's an article where Jerry Seinfeld used a similar method to motivate himself to be productive by seeing the string of days where he did what he needed to do to become successful. You see the chain of days start to build up and it inspires you to keep going and ""don't break the chain!"" This app does that and more. And at a great price.",5
9401,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I love this app. There are a lot of people who think that the ""streak strat"" is mostly a gimmick and isn't their preferred path to habit success. Habitbull is centered around streaks, sure, but its just overall the nicest designed app with the most fumctionality whilst maintaining a simple UI. My only criticism is the lack of support for editing the habitbull percentage. As somebody who doesnt focus on streaks hugely, seeing the percentage is obnoxious and I wish I could toggle it.",4
9402,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I love this so much. From reminders to tracking to really useful data!! It's a big deal that this isn't a reward system either, because I want to avoid disincentives and keep the habit. Ive already been successful with increasing water! truely worth digging into and adjusting the reminders, type of goal, etc. The options are really helpful in making the data relevant.

When i logged into my account, i had to recreate my habits again and check off the days i did it right, AGAIN. Plz do not let this happen again. I love this app because it is helping me 100% so far, but if it keeps crashing.. i hope that i find another app that works just as well.",3
9672,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"As a premium member, I'm disappointed that there's no autosync feature. Find it frustrating that my phone and tablet are completely out of sync unless I manually sync them. Not great, considering premium is not considerably cheap. Also the daily notification, I should be able to set a time for it to pop up daily like Habitica",2
9673,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I've used the app for a couple weeks, and it's worked really well. The notifications work well. It asks you whether or not you continued the habit. I do wish it were more clear to answer yes or no in the app. The interface is a calendar that you tap once for yes two for no. I've tried some of the other templates, but found they didn't work as well as a simple yes no. I'd recommend this app if you want a simple tool for tracking habits.",4
9674,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The free version lets you keep track of up to 5 habits. You can see all of your habits in the week view, but not the month view.

It's a shame! Edit. Problems all solved thanks.",5

9677,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I do use this to create new habits like fitness, and it works great.  But I also use it for household stuff: reminding my household to do chores. I'm not being a jerk, but I exist in a house with 4 other adults, and I'm the only one with any drive or ambition, and they simply won't do chores without me telling them to. If you're in this situation, this app is your answer. (Don't tell me to motivate them, or leave them alone and they'll catch on, it doesn't work. They're happy living in filth.)  I have daily and weekly reminders to nag them to do their chores. It works great.    Summary: if you need things done on a recurring basis, this app is awesome.",5
9678,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Of all if the other apps like this, this one is one of the best. I like that it is decently customizable, you can set alarms and add numbers to your habits without actually opening the app.   I only wish it was more comprehensive when graphing. I have a habit that is ""no more than..."" and I haven't quite figured out if it is tracking my numbers the right way. You can go into the negative and that is confusing to me.   Otherwise, I will definitely be using this app more. Please don't start charging!",5
9679,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Was the unlucky owner of the galaxy note 7 who purchased premium then switched phones. No longer works on my lg. Keeps telling me to upgrade to premium then doesn't give me the option to. Widgets won't work since it doesn't recognize me as as a premium customer despite using the same Google account on Google play.

After several emails, and a Facebook post, it's now working, paid features and all. So far, I've at least been more conscious of things I'm working on, but that was before the paid features. Here's hoping the paid was worth the time and effort! :-)",4
9681,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"You just add some habits and keep track. Really simple. The UI is good but still feels cluttered. I like it more than just red or green like the apple version but it still feels like more could be done. Until I figure out what exactly, i'll rate this 5 stars :) pretty darn good.",5
9682,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Very useful app! It helps you to lose bad habits like nail biting. With the pro version you can use the widgets, that I find very helpful to quickly track the habit. Among the widgets, you can find a counter (to count for example how many times you bite your nails) that resets every day automatically. I was looking for that. Good job!",5
9683,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I like this app a lot. Not only does it allow you to schedule reminders for each goal and provide an encouraging, if simple, line to show your streaks, it allows you to write notes for each day. That feature sold me on it. The only thing I'm not a big fan of is the silly messages in the push notifications.  But as the dev so helpfully replied, this can be turned off in settings. Plus, there's a dark theme!  Love it!",5

9685,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Simple and effective. Wouldn't mind more features, like some sort of accountability, automatic new daily quote, and perhaps the most important one, to have more grades of success, not just Green (Yes) and Red (No).",4
9686,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I really like this app... I have been using it for 2 weeks to track habits. There are a few things I wish it would do. I would like to be able to add photos to days and create a way to make a group that can track habits together and encourage each other.,5
9687,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,this is exactly what I was looking for in order to track my habits and try to get more consistent with my workouts and several other areas of my life that I was severely lacking and it's working! I tend to be a procrastinator and with habit bill I Am remembering to do the things that I should be doing. I love this app. It's honestly my favorite that I've ever used.,5
9688,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I really like this app, it has gotten me to create a habit that I had put off for the last two years. My one gripe is that the description for the activity (for the activity as a whole not the day) and reminders could be integrated a little better. The description was confusing at first and still not very useful. I would much prefer it if there was a way to see the description automatically instead of having to tap on the colored bar. I also would like to see customizable reminders rather than the default.",4

9690,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I have paid for premium version of the app for getting widgets. I am not impressed by the design of the widgets. I think that more designs can be added to improve the premium experience. (vd. app named ""month"" they have some awesome widgets). It would also be worthwhile if we see frequent updates as the app and widgets malfunction on rare occasions.",1
9691,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Very neat and extremely useful. However it would be really helpful if %completion of ""All habits"" was based on priority of habit. I want to inculcate a lot of habits however some of them are low priority and some are high priority. For example, ""exercise in the morning"" is high priority habit and ""going for walk after dinner"" is a lower priority habit. If I complete one of them it says 50% completed.  U can probably add another field to each habit identifying its priority and higher the priority, higher it should contribute to the completion. For example in the above case, considering with every lower priority habit its contribution to completion% reduces by 10%(say), priority1 habit contributes 55% and priority2 habit contributes 45% to the overall completion%. The changes become significant if the number of priority levels are increased to say 4, the %s of each level in decreasing order of priority will then be 40%, 30%, 20% and 10%. This can be very helpful as I would like to concentrate in completing the higher priority habits first so that every day my % is higher.",4

9697,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"For a habit where specific numbers have to be entered (e.g., I want to do 150 reps of some exercise daily), the following little tweaks would make a world of difference to me (and probably make me pay for the Pro app):  1. Tap the habit button from the weekly view => get a Yes option if I did the specified number of reps (which saves me entering everything manually, over and over again), or a No option 2. For a No: the next text field comes up *active* (the cursor in the field, and the keyboard up) and cleared and ready for the new input 3. The number format in that field (decimals) needs to be either customizable in the habit>Edit options, or remembered from the last input 4. The modal would be scrollable, so I could get to the Comments field (not just from the keyboard>Next) 5. The input in the Comments field could be submitted by tapping Next/Go from the keyboard (and maybe - as a customizable option - dismiss the whole modal saving yet another tap)  Right now, the sequence (8 taps for each habit) feels less than efficient - which makes me much less likely to stick with the app (and my good habits) in the long run:  (Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Android 6.0.1)",4

10112,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Two weeks in using this app and I'm really happy with it, simple to use and a great tool- I find it really helpful in changing bad habits and forming good ones. Update - have bought pro/platinum version and it's great, been using for over a month and good changes happening in my life. The more I use it the more I realize just how awesome it is.",5
10113,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,It's been helpful to have a consistent way of tracking goals. I don't have specific feedback but would say it's just ok (maybe premium version is better). It's good to get reminders to track and nice to have a record of what you have achieved. I don't have any criticisms and ultimately this won't make you form habbits. It's just a tool to help. Maybe with more use I'll rely on it more. For now I would reccomend but nothing too special to comment about.,4
10114,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"If seeing a row of red crosses doesn't get you started, nothing will. It almost mocks you, reminding you of your failures. After an initial two weeks of red crosses in a row, I somehow managed to beat it and keep the streak going...This was what I expected from this app.",5
10115,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Easy to keep track of multiple goals at a glance. It can be as annoying as you want to make it in reminding you to check in, which is great. Syncs with Google fit so I don't ever have to enter any fitness numbers. My one complaint is that it's terrible at setting up a weight loss goal. I want to set up a goal to lose a pound a week but it's trying really hard to make it a daily goal and set it in kg.",4
10116,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It has really helped me to create positive habits. I feel guilty if I don't log on & check off my habits. And I feel amazing when everything is checked off & I have a string of consecutive days. UI is really great, too. Never had an issue. Thank you, Habitbull!",5
10117,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Great app with tons of useful features!  Could you please fix several small bugs to make it perfect? :) 1) When side menu is open, ""back"" button should close it first, then close the app (see how it works in Gmail and Play Market apps). Now it closes the whole app on the first press, which is VERY annoying. 2) Prevent input of negative numbers (couldn't think of a habit where I need to run -5 miles or drink -3 liters of water) Features request: 1) DARK THEME (both true black for AMOLED lovers, and gray for the rest of us) 2) In habit settings add a checkbox to use only integer numbers for this habit (for number of times etc). 3) Show small habit numbers on the calendar view for each day (make it cofigurable in settings) Thank you in advance!",4
10118,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This is the most flexible app for developing new habits that I have ever come across. The user interface is super neat. I was so impressed right off the bat I decided to get the premium. It was worth it, the widgets makes it so much more efficient!",5

10121,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Used for a couple of weeks.  Uninstalled for an app that will allow more than 5 goals for free.  During usage, the thing I disliked the most was the reminder greeting such as, ""Hiya Angel!"".  I just would've liked my goal to pop up..plain and simple.  My brain would often shut off before even reading the reminder.  It was annoying.  Other than those and the goal restriction of 5, no other complaints. Lots of setting options was nice.",3
10122,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Even if I am tired from work or in public I still do my habits because it's has to get done. 20 push ups in my jobs hallway. Done. Say something nice to a stranger. Done. This app keeps me focused to the point I don't think about it. Get it now. Why are you still reading this. I'm rambling now. Go ahead. Do it. Make me proud. Wasting time. Stop procrastinating. Old habit. Hey listen gtg tell someone they got something in their teeth. Easy. One,5
10123,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Trying out the free version. Features look really good - BUT it absolutely slaughters my CPU and battery and the app itself is incredibly slow.  (I am not even using any reminders or Google Fit integration). So I might have to uninstall simply for that reason. It makes it hard to use and it seems to jeopardize the use of my phone in general.,2
10124,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,They know that being nagged increased your resistance to doing it. So they are always funny and affirming in their reminders. I like all the functionality. Best habit app.,5
10125,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I have the paid version and it was well worth the little money. Writing this review because the app deserves 5 stars.,5

10258,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Still trying to get my premium back,3
10259,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,The app has a clean interface and is easy to use and on that basis it is worthwhile. However changing phones has been a snafu and my premium membership hasn't meant anything. Support took a week for the initial response and merely repeated the FAQS. Which I had noted did not resolve the issues in my request for assistance. On the basis of support alone I would look elsewhere. Google calendar now supports goals so I'll probably use that.,2
10260,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"HabitBull really is flexible and fun to use. I like seeing my string of sucesses grow. The only things I might add would be the ability to give myself a monthly or weekly day off without breaking the streak for regularly scheduled events or emergencies. For instance, I stay away from processed foods except when I go shopping once a month.",4
10261,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The app is useful and is quite flexible in usage. But FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, please stop with the painfully cheesy greetings in the reminders.

10262,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The developers appear to activity listen to users and currently have a good product.

I want to give this a 5 star rating but I need this on my IOS devices too.  The syncing between multiple devices and getting your reports in CsV format is a dream of a security blanket though. =.),4
10264,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This is a great app and works perfectly for what I need. The notifications don't work for me at all, and I feel the export although a CSV is great its really useless. A better PDF with quick information and data would be better. I'm running the paid version as I want to track more than 5 at a time, good to see if that if you don't pay you get full functionality all the same.",3
10265,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The interface is clean and setting up each habit is simple enough. Data pulled from Google Fit is a little spotty and doesn't update all the time. Also the motivational quote/images always changes when you upvote or downvote them. I would prefer to upvote and let them stay on the screen and have a ""next"" button to get a different image.",4
10266,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I love this app and have found it does a great job helping me hold myself accountable for various things.  I just wish you could change the goal peroid.  For example, I have a goal of doing 100 exercises per week, but the app only let's you do per day.  Not a deal breaker, just set it for 25 per day 4 days a week, but I wish I had the other option.  That's the only reason I took off one star",4
10267,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I love this app. I love that you get to record your success and create a chain of successful days, really motivates me to keep going. Also love that I can set reminders for things (eg I'm rubbish at remembering to drink enough water and I'm able to set a reminder that goes off every couple of hours to tell me to refill my glass.)",5
10268,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I did my homework on these habit tracking apps and decided I liked Habit Bull's clean interface and ease of use. It really doesn't complicate the process of tracking which makes it easy to use and extremely motivating. I'm able to see my progress at a glance and enter data in quickly without any unnecessary UI impediment. I highly recommend it.,5
10269,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I immediately bought the upgrade, because this is easily the best tracking app I've used. The one improvement I'd love to see is the ability to have a ""tracking only"" type habit that doesn't count against your active goals. When you want to record things over a period it time, but they happen infrequently, it really messes with your numbers.",4

Still figuring it out, but so far so good.",5
10271,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I've used a lot of goals apps before, but never any that have worked quite as well as habitbull. It keeps you very motivated and one feature I really like is that it keeps track of how many days until it becomes a complete habit for you. *****",5
10272,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Nice clean interface that makes it easy to track how well you're doing with a specific goal. I've been using this to ensure I hit my targets for saving money this year. The reminder system is particularly useful as it pops up before I leave for work and reminds me not to forget my lunch.,5
10273,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I tried a few. This one was the best to me. I like the widget, the motivational reminders, and all the options for different types of goals. And as others have said it's very intuitive, efficient and useful. The only thing I wish I could do that I'm unable to with Habit Bull is start a week on a different day than Sunday or Monday (I want Saturday because that's when my P90X week starts).",4
10274,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I think it is good and funny to the measure of my usage. I found it a bit hard to change the title of a habit since i need to go through a lot of things. Also when modifying it then you can ask what type of edit is it. Since i could be editing my goals down instead of up. Need more motivational notifications , like ""you can do it, you can set your eyes on it"" or maybe send us some videos.",4
10275,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I like the layout and ease of setting up and using this app. I like that there are different options for tracking (e.g. counts, quantities) and different reminder frequencies. Haven't shared yet, but could see how that can be helpful. The reminder texts are kind of annoying at times (trying too hard to be funny), but on the other hand good not to take yourself too seriously and add pressure to forming habits.",4

All the little touches make it a joy to use, and after using Habitbull for about a month I can already see my habits changing and my life improving. Great for anyone who's been trying to get back on their feet after depression or rock bottom.",5
10277,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Very nice app for tracking habits. The design and functionality are way above similar apps. The only thing that would have bumped it to five stars is if the multi device sync was automatic. The widget on the second device will not be accurate until the app is launched and the sync is done, defeating the glance-able purpose of the widget.",4
10278,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Has most of the features of what I was looking for in an app to track my progress on goals. I'd like to be able to use it alongside my friends so we can work on each other's personal goals together / compete but I know the app developers are working on it. It doesn't look like it's suitable for complex goals though.,4
10279,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"One thing I like when I try to create habits is not to be judged. Habit bull does that by being very factual. There is no excessive motivational messages. You see your calendar and you check what you did, boom that's it. Simple is beautiful and so is habitbull.",5
10280,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I have been using this for about a week. I find it straightforward and useful. I like the visual of the calendar and the accoutability has been just enough to keep me motivated. It utilizes simple habit forming strategies that motivate you psychologically and keep the experience simple. I advise you to read the user article about ""How to use habitbull"". Good advice, the gist of it is pick 1-3 attainable goals. Habits take time, set yourself up for success.",4
10281,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"So far it delivers as expected from a habit tracker/changer. However, it lags upon opening the app and I've tested whether or not it will notify me if the app itself is closed. i would buy the premium if the app becomes smoother and notifies user even if it's closed... I am using an Alcatel Flash Plus unit.",3

The visual display of progress (success/failure) drives you to complete tasks. Amazing for a procrastinator!

10284,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Well thought out. My only gripe is that the screen swipe is too sensitive. As you are trying to Mark your goals completed or failed comma the screen constantly goes to the next page instead of marking the goal. You are always having to swipe back to the previous page that you inadvertently switched from. Other than that minor inconvenience, the app is excellent.",5
10285,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I've tried dozens of habit tracking apps and this one is a clear winner.  I wish it had the ability to put habits on hold for times like vacation days where completing my habits isn't possible.  I also wish it could handle goals over longer periods like weekly or monthly.  But those are fairly minor issues in an otherwise great app.,4
10286,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It's so much easier to get into good habits (& out of bad ones) with reminders & a little accountability, & Habitbull does both. Quick & easy to set up, I found it so useful I upgraded to the pro version after only a couple of days",5

10288,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"While it doesn't do the work for you. This app makes it easy to track and establish new habits. It tracks data on each new habit and while the free version only lets you track a handful of habits simultaneously, with the premium version you can track more than you can poke a stick at. I highly recommend this app. Get the free version and check it out for yourself!",5
10289,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Minimalist, straightforward design but still flexible. Easy to use on a daily basis as it's not bogged down with features. Innately customizable for different types and frequencies of habits. Can have some habits that NEED to be done regularly, as well as others that you are simply interested in tracking. My only criticism is that 66 days is a bit too ambitious of a starting # for most. Better to start with small goals, like a 3 day streak.",5
10290,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Lots of options and very customisable. I've found it very helpful. Only annoyance is you can't change the details of a habit once started, for example to increase target reps.

Reactivate a habit and it'll count the period of deactivation against you.",2
10293,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I like using the app. Bought the premium version that allows you to track more options, which I think os worthwhile. There are a few tweaks in the interface that I'd like though. For instance, scrolling through the weeks in the calendar view is sometimes cumbersome. I sometimes accidentally slide back to previous weeks without meaning to. I like it because it keeps me honest about how much I'm doing something but there have been days where I fall off and completely forget about the app.",4
10294,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The format is sleek, but I'm not going to pay for what I can get just as well through another app for free.

The interface is simple enough to get out of the way, without limiting the functionality of the application.  Whilst I'm sure I could of achieved the same outcome without the app, there have been days when I've only fulfilled minor habits because I've been tracking them.   Highly recommended!",5
10296,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Use this just to keep my mind on doing the small things every week when my job and motherhood keep me busy- read, work out, get up early and study. I like the calander and layout, which allows you to quickly identify if you are winning or losing. Plus, having it wrote down somewhere solidifies that you said you would do this, holding yourself accountable. Checking it off with the little green circle adds the satisfying layer of 'i did it'.",5
10297,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I have been using this app for some time and it has really helped me to achieve some new habits. It is simple to set up and quite easy to use.

Would be great to track this visually.",5

There isn't an explicit skip today button, but it does take into account the number of days per week that u want to accomplish certain things.

If I log each step toward my daily goal I'd like to see the progress. Maybe that circle could be a pie chart that shows what percentage of the daily target I'm at.

I'd like to see one change: don't count a day as failed until that day is complete. It was a bit of a downer to see on the third day 66% when I don't do that thing until evening. I'm conditioned to see that as a failing grade. Of course, I faulted the app rather than feeling like a failure.

I just wish they had an option for a weekly goal - so rather than a habit like 'read at least 5 pages at least 3 days a week' it could be 'read at least 15 pages a week' so if I'm busy I can get it done in one day if needed. Also graphs for habits with numerical inputs (hours at gym by week) would be nice.,4
10330,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I downloaded 2-3 Habit Tracking apps (still have them installed) assuming I would check which one I prefer best. This fit my needs so well.. it's so much nicer & more motivating than just a regular reminder - it's well thought out and designed specifically for Habits and it shows :),5
10331,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Setting your habits/targets are straightforward with some flexible preset parameters. And updating and tracking your daily/weekly/monthly/random activities is simple. Haven't spent much time yet on data analysis so don't know and won't comment on  its value. I purchased the in-app add-on. Overall satisfied. Thanks,4
10332,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I absolutely love it. Thankfully it is a constant reminder that there are things to do and sometimes not do. Really helped with acquiring some short and long term habits.  Easy to program and there's a nice online community for like minded habit forming folks.,5
10333,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I love this app. You set your own habits and terms. The reminders help to keep you on track and it charts your success. It has helped me both personally and professionally. I did have a password issue so I didn't have it for a bit and realized then how much this app helps to keep me on track. The company was great to work with, they resolved the issue and had be back up & running. I highly recommend this app!",5

10352,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This is a simple concept,  yet the success lies in its simplicity. You do a task (upon which reminders can be set) and you tick it off for the day. You do this until it becomes like second nature. I have been using it to take cold showers every day,  and I haven't missed one yet. It is an easy app to use,  and the discussions/habits of other members is a nice touch,  as it's nice to see what others are attempting, and it gives the sense of comradeship when trying to complete your own habit day to day.",5

10354,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I never give 5 stars because I know things can always be improved upon. But I am defiantly loving this app. I would love to be able to save the images as jpegs rather than having to do a screen shot of the ones I really like to save on my phone.,4
10355,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Pretty straightforward, nice appearance, and reliable.

The act alone of setting goals for one's self is enough to increase happiness and productivity, however the daily view into one's progress towards an eventual goal is quite rewarding.  Overall, I have made some amazing changes in my life, and this app has helped me to achieve those goals.

10421,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,This is a full fledged habit tracker application with solid potential. I use it everyday. I would like to have it converted to Google Material Design though.,5

10423,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The app is definitely great for forming habits. Can be annoying seeing those notifications with their often strangely worded motivational quotes, but I guess that's why it's so effective. The interface has some minor issues when switching between tasks. All and all a great app.",4

10427,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Generally, this is the streamlined option I was looking for... I rated a 3 instead of 4 or 5 because I use the #/day option for a few very important reminders. I've found that the ""Add"" option doesn't always work properly and that can be really problematic. I would appreciate a flash of ""2 out of 3"" or ""Completed: 2"" as confirmation.",3

10430,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,The only reason I rated this 4 instead of 5 is because you can only track 5 habits on the free version.  I would have liked to have been able to track some specific habits that I've had to lump into groups instead.,4

10443,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Habitbull really does motivate me and I'm enjoying tracking my goals.  A suggestion for improvement: the calendar swipes too easily to the left or right when i am scrolling down.  Think it is a bit sensitive.,5
10444,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I absolutely love this app. I've been trying to develop habits with various apps but this app is so easy to use.,5
10445,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I don't like the fact that you can only track 5 items for the free version. But it's very diverse and has a variety of things to track. I'm still exploring it,4
10446,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Although it is a very helpful app. So if you're trying to get rid of any habits this is what you need. Provided you're truthful to yourself.,4

10476,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I'm very happy with the full version. Love the widgets; they help keep me on track. Best app for changing behavior and forming new habits that i have seen and i have looked at 9 or 10.,5
10477,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"In all its a great app. Unfortunately it's utterly frustrating to use due to the lag. I'm not talking about a half second here or a second or so there, I'm talking 10 seconds to open or quit the app and similar to check off a habit. I'm gutted because I liked the look of it from the start and didn't hang about to to go premium as I liked the idea of the widgets (which are also a bit big). So that's £4 down the drain. It'd be 5 stars from me but until it's updated to run smoothly it's 2 stars at best.",2

10483,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Unlike many apps on the store, this one is developed by someone who cares about its use and its users. I sometimes forget to use the app but the app doesn't forget me (without being obnoxious), and that's a good thing!",5
10484,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Better than a calendar reminder because it let's me keep my personal daily reminders separate without cluttering up regular appointments and meetings. I did turn off the goofy messages they were really annoying.,5

10509,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Very good to check your progress          I reducted one star because for habits it's either pass or fail          Example when I say I have to read 20 pages a day and I read 19 pages the app will give me the exact result as if I have read 0 pages!

12141,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I've always had a mental list of a handful of habits I wanted to be better about keeping. This app is a great tool to help form habits. It works. Start slow (just one or two at a time) and make it a point to use the app everyday. The app does a good job keeping it quick and simple to update yet provide views with stats to show analysis of your progress.,4
12142,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I liked it enough to buy it. It is very helpful and I think the ability to tweak each individual habit has made it easy to add habits and achieve success. It's too much of a drag to use something free that doesn't really work for my particular goals. I'd rather use my time doing other things.,5
12143,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Very helpful for trying to establish habits and make them stick. Really appreciate the widget as well. A small issue I run into is that the swipe action (that moves between weeks) is too sensitive. Sometimes when I try to mark a day, it moves the calendar on accident. Would be nice if this gesture required a longer sideways swipe.",4
12144,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Choosing sync directs you to create account (makes sense) but after creating an account then choosing the same sync option, turns to upgrade. Makes me wonder what else could be bait and switch. Honesty is a great habit to build ;) Edit: I'm aware of that, I'm referring to in-app feature messaging. Just a suggestion.",2
12145,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I liked all kinds of settings in the reminders.  But if I can see all 'habits' in monthly view in one screen (not just one week), that would be awesome.   Also, when setting comments on a habit that keeps track of the number of times you have done it, I'd have to remove the keyboard in order to press 'done'; there should be a done button on the keyboard so that you won't have to do remove the keyboard all the time.",5
12146,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I'm really enjoying the app so far. I've only been using it for a little over a week but I can feel myself forming healthier habits because this holds me accountable. I wish the forums were easier to navigate and find posts about things I'm interested in. But so far I'm enjoying it a lot and I've been considering getting the full version once I get further into my current habits.,4
12147,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It's much easier to keep in track of everything you want to do with this app. The automatic daily notifications and streaks of days of accomplishment are a really good encouraging factor for you to do your best. I would suggest having more notification descriptions and more motivating images, but otherwise this is awesome.",4
12148,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Like the app, and even purchased the in app upgrade. The thing that irks me is the 'rate me' popup when I open the app, and no option to disable it forever.  Since you decided to harass me into rating you, I did.  Update: As a user don't care what you want. If I don't feel strongly enough to rate your extension, I won't. I don't want you badgering once a week to rate it. Give an option to 'Never ask again', and it'll be acceptable to show that notification. Without that option, it's harassing spam.",1
12149,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I adore this app. I do believe there is some room for improvement, but I sense it will only get better with time. It has helped  me tremendously with adopting the habits I want in my life and it keeps me on track! I cannot find another app that works for me as well. I have honestly tried to find a worthy competitor, but there doesn't seem to be one. Keep up the good work.  Love the premium version.",4
12150,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Takes abit of time, but habit bull has showed me that being accountable for habits can be really effective. Often we negate past victories because we forget. Now we can remind ourselves of our own capabilities and work on them. Also.... its a simple cool app. Tks Habitbull",5
12151,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Does what it says on the tin, looking forward to the web interface, but the app (so far at least) is the best I've tried. I was using joe's goals, but due to technical issues there and the site being more off line than on recently, I was forced to make a jump, I landed on this app, and it was a great place to land.",5
12152,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Haven't used it to much since I've downloaded it, although it has gotten me a little on track in order to think abiut what I need to be doing and prioritizing, instead of all the useless task lists I set for myself. Also, a lot of businesspeople I work with highly recommend this in order to get focused on the tasks you NEED to finish, not keep you busy.",5
12153,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Features I'd like... * Export my information into standard file types like CSV.  * This is the kind of thing I like to see become more than just a phone app; perhaps you could make it more like a service with a Web app client synced to the phone app. Making it IFTTT friendly too would be great.  * I wouldn't pay a subscription for it, but think of the potential for targeted advertising.   With that said I would definitely recommend this app to friends and family.",5
12154,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I love the interface, the organisation, ease of use and the fun, creative reminders. It has made a difference to my days. I wish for the option to reset the entries for the habits - I need to track afresh for each month, and right now I'm having to delete each habit and create it anew each month. Other than that, 5 stars. Thank you!",5
12155,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I've been using the premium version of this app for a few weeks now and I have been loving every second of it! It works tremendously to break bad habits. I recently had a problem with using the app after a factory reset but an email to HabitBull and I got an almost instant, friendly, helpful response. Amazing customer service!",5
12156,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I went through a few before deciding on a winner. It's simple, clean looking, and effective. Cute reminders that don't make me hate them and a great assortment of widgets from which to choose. You have to upgrade to premium but it's definitely worth it- even for someone as frugal as I am haha.",5
12157,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"One big limitation of many other apps is that they only track every day habits, which is useless if there is something I want to do four times a week.  Not a problem with this app; so many options, but very easy to use.",5
12158,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I've only been using it for just over a week.  However, it has already helped me stay consistent with 3 different habits I've been struggling to make for about 2 years.  It's nice to see your progress lined out for you.  It functions perfectly, and I highly recommend it!",5
12159,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Best habit logging app I've used. It's advantage over other apps is that it is really easy to see what you have already logged that day...seems like an obvious thing but most of the other apps I've tried got this wrong. Also the data (e.g. charts) on your streaks, previous days etc. is easily accessible rather than being hidden away like on many other apps.",5
12160,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Once you get the hang of it, this app is simply perfect for habit building. I love its simplicity. Also like the community messages with tips and tricks on building your habits. You guys did awesome! Only slightly annoyed with the picture on the home page, been the same since forever...",5
12161,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I really like this app, it's easy to use and has great options to configure habits e.g. colour coding, reminders.  The offered widgets (premium only) are lacking however and I don't use any of them.  Too simplistic, fonts far too large and need more tweakability to suit different users.  The 1x1 widget could include a number showing how many habits remaining for the day.  A 4x4 or 4x2 widget size, with improved options, smaller fonts would make this a 5/5 app for me.  Well done though.",4
12162,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I had been putting off my studies and a lot of other things I was meant to do throughout the day. But thanks to this app and it's reminders, I've become more productive because it always feels good when you complete and cross off  the productive things you were meant to do each day.",5
12163,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Pros: I am getting great use out of this. Love the widget. Cons: I get confused that I  have to be in monthly view to see my stats and notes at a glance, and on my LG Intuition, when I swipe down on the calendar it goes to the next habit instead of my notes. Feels like there's a learning curve about the 3 views: menu, monthly, and weekly.",4
12164,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I found the ""n times a day"" habit slightly confusing to set up, but generally clear to use, good feedback from the calendar display of progress. On a later version, really getting to like this. It's great you can set a habit to ""x times a week"", for example ""exercise 3 times a week"". I also like the funny reminders to use habitbull daily, and the inspirational images.",4
12165,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Use this and stick to it.. It is difficult at first but once you get into it you will acheive those goals! Wake up earlier and gym, read 2 chapters a day, eat less bread and fatty food.. Its all trackable here.",5
12166,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It would be nice to not get notifications for habits I've already accomplished. I want to keep the reminders turned on for when I forget to do them, but it's annoying to go check one off early and still get a reminder for later it once it's already been completed. Will rate 5 again if fixed.",3
12167,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I think this is a good app for creating good habits.  It keeps me aware when I have to give my log in at the end of the day.  My only suggestion would be to have some sort of alarm or reminder at a certain time u could set. Because on my busier days I forget and have to log it in the next day.  Other than that great app.  Thanks,4
12168,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I bought the premium version. Its worth it if you jave the discipline to ise the app... Just one thing..when we lock it, the number of reminders is hardly anything. Would be nice if we could have reminders despite the lock, maybe in a controlled manner",5
12169,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I really like this app for keeping me on track with my goals. The best part about it is the reminders it gives you. They aren't annoying and sent too often  like other app alerts. The alerts are snarky and cute but still give you a gentle reminder to log your daily efforts. The downside to this app is you need to buy the deluxe version (or whatever they're calling it) to track more than five habits. That part is a tad annoying. Overall I think it's worth your time and memory space on your phone.,4
12170,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This app is great for tracking and developing new habits.   Lots of great options, yet simple and easy-to-use.  You can track habits based on different criteria (done or not done, a number, etc.), set options for doing something every day, certain days of the week or a certain number of times in a given period, and set up reminders to keep you on track.",5
12171,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"1000 times better than my excel tracker & also better than other similar apps. The only improvement I can think of would be being able to land on the ""All Habits"" page which gives you a nice overview, rather than always landing on the 1st habit you logged. It would save users from having to constantly switch habits. Unintended downside of the weekly view/stats(especially for low priority objectives): once you've broken a streak, that week is lost, isn't it? Tempting not to bother till the next Monday :)",4
12172,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Feature rich, useful and looking good UI. Worth 5 stars. It would be better to select ""Success, Failed or Cancel"" with popup instead of tapping multiple times. Need ""Default action/value or Failed Status"" for those days that user forgot or did not set.",5
12173,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The day before I saw this app I had told myself that I wanted to get an app that would help me keep track of some changes I wanted to make in my life. Habitbull is perfect for exactly that. Doesn't matter what you're wanting to change (quit smoking, start walking every few days, etc) this app will help.. You can set habits based on a did I do this today, yes or no? Or you can do like a certain number per day (like situps or glasses of water) or even a certain number of times per week. Check it out!",5
12174,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,It's helping me keeping up with my goals and it's working!! The only things I would add is big  pop-up  remainders for the scheduled habits and a rewarding system (I would love an implemented  IFTT like system:  if you reach x days / weeks then do this),5
12175,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"You know, I went through a good number of habit apps before this one. everyone had their little knacky niche to them, but HabitBull is simple, and straightforward. I'd recommend it. It's at least worth your time to test out.",5
12176,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,This is a great app for monitoring good and bad habits that you want to change or maintain! It's helped me with fitness goals :-) It does what it says on the tin and I like the widget. My only complaint is that you can't open the app from the widget so I have to have the app icon on my screen as well as the widget,4

12180,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It's particularly helpful to be able to select exactly which days I want to complete a task, as opposed to the 'recurring every x days' format used by many other apps.  Being able to create unlimited tasks with the paid version is worth every penny.  In an ideal world it would be useful to be able to set differing snooze lengths for each task, and also to be able to select the preferred notification sound (again perhaps different sounds for each task), but neither of these affect the overall usability.",5
12181,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It is very good app. I even bought full version. After few months of using it it started feeling too much complex for my needs.

12878,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Dear Team - I  wanted to do a trail run of the free app and install the paid version if i like it. The app interface is good but the reminders are not working on the app. Even though i have set up the reminder i am not getting any notification. This pretty much renders it useless for me especially when i have included habits with recurring reminders throughout the day. Please please please fix this.,3
12879,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This is really helping me build some habits into my life. Would like it if some graphs and other methods such as a game where you get points for sticking to the habit. I'm sure the graph might be available if you pay, but I would be willing to have the graph in trade off for advertisements",5
12880,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Upon my first use of this app it begged me to rate it, so my rating is 1*. Maybe if I had a chance to use the app before being obnoxiously pressed into rating, it may have scored higher. Probably a 3 if it was perfect, because I don't appreciate this rate begging at any time",1
12881,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I've been needing an app to show me how often I do the things I need to do, I mean I might have as well marked a big paper each day but this app makes it very easy and organized. All the details I needed were there without making the app clunky. It works pretty smooth too",5
12882,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Habitbull as an app itself is good but the widget is starting to malfunction. I have a good amount of habits, around 7, that I want to keep track of. I use the widget (an entire screen dedicated to the widget ) to mark my success with the habit without opening the app. However, I have noticed that the amount of habits displayed on the widget have slowly started to decrease starting from 7 to 5 to now only 2.  EDIT: thanks to customer service, I have realized the reason for my problem :)",5
12883,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"After ages of making little progress with goals like going to the gym more, getting more sleep, etc, I tried this app. Writing the goals down in it and tracking progress makes all the difference. It's fully functional but worth paying small price to unlock widgets and to support developer. Great.",5
12884,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Feature suggestion: display a user defined default value when marking a task completed. For example, if I usually meditate 45 minutes every day, the input field default value should be 45 and not 0.  Update: changed rating to 5* for the immediate response from developers and also in hope of future re-enablement of this feature as an option :-)",5
12885,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I love HabitBull. It's helped me make new, productive and positive habits as well as helping me break some of the negative habits I had in my life. If you're serious about making changes in your life then you need HabitBull.",5
12886,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"At first I downloaded it to check it out, honestly I didn't think I would use it much. After reading the forums on how to use it, I've been obsessed, it's super easy and really useful. Keeps my goals on my mind, like a log with out having to log too much or take up too much time. PLUS the developers are AMAZING! they are real, and respond to you honestly, they care and want to help. Which makes it so much more personal! Give it a try, it could change your life :)",5
12887,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The keyboard on my phone is in the way when I need to click on the Set button. So I need to turn the phone sideways, then back upright to get the screen to scroll down so the button's visible.",4
12888,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Really good app. Now it's only up to me whether I can manage my habits.  However, one thing: Changing an existing habit from ""yes/no"" type to another is not possible. Would be great, if that's somehow manageable in the future :)",5
12889,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I have used the app for months and love it! There were some issues with the widgets but operating fine now. I track everything as success or not. Habitbull makes it so easy to track progress and really look at my habits. Customization of the widget would be nice,5

12893,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I didn't think it would make a difference since I'm pretty on top of what I want to do but the app really helps to hit my goals every single day.,5

12897,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"What i love about this app is the  alarming. This is what I use it for the most. Everything else is very nice also.

12898,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I haven't used it that much but it does everything I wanted it to do, so far. I downloaded a similar app at the same time and I haven't even opened it because I've been using this one. Keep up the good work.",5

12902,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Just improve its user interface and also remove some bugs with the notification. None the less... A very good app,5
12903,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Yes/No tracking with notes is fine, though not ideal. Tracking with numbers, which could have been ideal, is crippled by the formula used. It also likes crashing and not responding when I switch to it from another app. Can't have correct streak target for habits begun before using app. Maybe it was designed for phones, but couldn't new habit set up be done on one page?",4
12904,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Actually a really good app, but it seems to lack a decent integration with android wear.",3
12905,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Easy to use. Motivating. The reminder to use was annoying.  The funny phrases are cute,5
12906,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Maybe the motivational settings are a bit childish. However, the notifications  are unobtrusive, and it's a creative and fun way to help you develop and maintain habits",4

12911,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It used to be great, purchased premium, but there haven't been any improvements for years now, eg diagrams could be improved, more complex rules for habits, ... Finally, the January update issues motivated me to look for another app.",3

12913,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Works like a charm... The only problem is me.. Habits are hard to break,5
12914,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,It's a very helpful application and really allowed me to get rid of things or gain new ones,5
12915,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I have downloaded other habit apps and this is by far the best. It's simple, no wierd colours and the non premium is not limited at all. Just brilliant.  X",5
12916,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,If you're already reading this then just go ahead and download the app because it does everything it claims and does it great. What I love about the app is that it's very simple and modest but that's all that's needed here so go on ahead and give it a shot,5
12917,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I love this app but ever since I have installed it, my battery drains very quickly.",1

12925,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,A great encourager for habit building.. Love the confidence boosters incorporated for habit  reminders.,4
12926,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,It does help build habits but really needs the ability to share with others.  Ideally see each other's progress.,3
12927,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Really helped me pick up some good habits, I highly recommend.",5

12932,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I'm pretty sure I downloaded and tried every habit app on android and this is the one. Intuitive but feature-rich with a good aesthetic. Just a quick question for the developers... Will you ever make this cross platform with iOS?? I would love to use it on my iPad too. Cheers.,5

I suspect that there is a conflict with Avast, but I didnt want to uninstall Avast to test. Tried reinstalling Habitbull and it initially worked but after closing down it wouldn't reopen. Hope the developers can look into the issue, I surely can't be the only person having problems.",3
13057,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This app is amazing! I love that I can keep track of so many things and how it gives me my progress. The only thing I wish you would change is that instead of only having the option to mark a day successful, have a scale of 1 to 10 and instead of seeing it complete everyday, you see the number. For instance, the stress level that day or how many hours of sleep. I know you have the option to put the number in but it would be a lot better if you had the option to have a scale of 1 to 10",4

This is perfect and simple for tracking all kind of habits, and you can even set categories and reminders if you wish.  I originally got it to track fitness, because the available fitness trackers had too many bells and whistles for me. I just wanted to track days and activity.

Still wish you could keep closer tabs on entered values to see your trends in a big picture or granular view of the data.   For example you could know what days you do the most push ups, you write the most lines of code on Tuesdays, or how many pages of books you've read since you started your habit.  This type of data is already present it's just hiding in entered values.",5

13063,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"this is the best app to build habits... but there are much better apps for other types of progressive goals.  GOAL TRACKER is another app that can do some things better than HabitBull.  For example, this app will help if you want to build a habit of saving money. But this app won't help you help you quantify your progress if you want to save $1000. So if you save $50 on Monday, and $311 on Tuesday, this app can't calculate your total accumulated.  It can help you build the habit of doing push ups every day. But it can't help you record the total number of push ups you've done over a period of time, or the progress of your maximum reps.   You could say there are other apps that can do these tasks, but i know it's not hard to include such a function. Who wants 4 apps to do all of this..? 1 app for finance, 1 app for exercise, 1 app for goals, 1 app for habits... 5 stars if this could calculate totals :')",3

13065,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I think it would be really awesome if Habitbull would do a better job graphing your progress on numeric goals. For example, if you were trying to run at least 2 miles per day, you could watch your daily run climb from 2 miles, to 2.5, to 3, etc. The app does do this, but the graph is very small and has no y-axis scale, making it difficult to interpret. I still think the app deserves 5 stars, but this would be a wonderful addition.  It would also be really useful if you could log into your account online to update your streaks when you're on your computer.",5

My only issue is that if you wish to alter your habit (say, increase the times of week you go to the gym from 4 to 5), the change is retroactive. Once you make the change, it counts all the previous weeks and drops your percentage. Other than that small issue it's great!",4

13319,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I have been trying to develop a few health habits for who knows how many years. Finally with this app I think i can make them stick. Checking off the item(s) per day is easy and i even get notitications to log in overdue entries if i miss more than a day, which has been really helpful to keep me from slacking with it. Awesome.",5
13320,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I was looking for something to help me track my progress at developing new better personal habits, and HabitBull was the first thing I found. I struck gold. HabitBull is sleek, user-friendly, powerful and everything I could have asked for. Most of all, it is effective. The habits are sticking and I'm already seeing benefits. I can't praise this app highly enough.",5
13321,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Works quite well so far. Two things that could be improved  1. Sync could cause crash sometimes, still not sure what kind of scenario would cause this though.  2. Would be good if we can set weekly goal. For example, study for 20 pomodoros within a week, no matter how many each day.",4
13322,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"This app is great to build habits for work and personal time.  I would definitely give it 5 stars if there was more granularity to habits.  If i could add an alarm for an hour before the end of a workday to remind me to stop taking on new tasks and complete documentation etc. for tasks i had completed in the day it would be wonderful.  It would help force a stop in the workday and a transition to personal time.  Of course, i may not have found out how to do this and it may already be included.",4
13323,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Have to manually force sync on each device which is cumbersome. Also would be useful to be able to change habit types, e.g. from yes/no to x no. of times per day/week. Otherwise a great app but could do with improving the UI.",3
13324,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,It's great that I don't have to open the app to see what habits are and also I can log progress directly via the on screen widget. This means there's no impediment to achieving habit forming behaviours.,5
13325,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I have tried many habit apps and Habit Bull is hands down the best. It is reliable and encouraging. I love the little notification with a random greeting prompting me to stick to my goals. It is persistent without being annoying and it is exactly what I need.,5
13326,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"You can track anything with this app.  Fantastic for people who want to count grams of protein or ounces of watet instead of calories.  Widget is great for seeing progress and reminding you to use the tracker.  My only wish is that yhe widget would allow you to enter numbers (instead of hitting +/-), but maybe that's an android issue.",5
13327,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Using the free version and it is super usefull for me. Only thing i would add is the option to enter data for progress tracking. For instance if you're trying to lose weight you could enter weight data and a graph would appear. There are separate apps for this but i would love to see it integrated.,4
13328,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"The name the style and the purpose, everything is terrific for this app. Nothing more or nothing less, just to make sure that you can make good habits, control bad habits if there is any. All you have to do is to make a simple habit of using habit bull! :-). My personal suggestion is that handle a couple of habits maximum 3 or 4 at a time. So that you can see the progress :be honest to yourself. If you looks and analyse habits every day I guarantee there will be progress",5
13329,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I have been using habit bull for a few months now. Positives: nice interface. Negatives: information too simplistic. For example, I cannot at a glance tell how many times I have failed in a particular task that I need to do every day. I need to go to each failed day view and manually count them. There are bugs. In my case, for one of the habits, the data is changing on its own. I have written to developer but have not received any response. Will see for another month before I delete the app.",1
13330,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I've only had it for just over a week (on recommendation from a friend who also loves it), and been Premium for a couple of days (a bargain at less than three quid), and yet I find a lot of my days are already spent working out how best to meet my goals, and what others I can add. The interface is clean, the data capture is intuitive, and the notifications are easy to customise. I'm still exploring the app, but that's not for lack of good design; on the contrary, it's because it's so good I'm still here.",5
13331,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Edit: the update very quickly changed the problem I was having. Thanks for the quick response.   Suddenly the widget started displaying only 25% of my goals. I can't solve this glitch, and assistance would be helpful. Otherwise, a practical app to build habits.",5

13659,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I've installed the premium version and have already noticed a couple of bugs, one of which makes me less inclined to use this application.  1) Major issue. The daily habit widget shows any repeating habit on a daily basis, which ruins the entire point of a repeating habit. If the habit is configured for once every 14 days, I shouldn't be asked if I performed it every day. Since many of my habits are repeating ones, this makes the widget and thus the app a nuisance until this is fixed.  2) Minor issue. Repeating tasks should not count the number of days until you reached your target date, rather the number of iterations. For example, if the task is to be done every 3 days, then the target date should be 198 days into the future and not 66.  I hope the first issue will be fixed in the upcoming version because at the moment the application isn't especially useful for someone who uses widgets and has repeating habits.  I'll be sure to update this review and score if these are fixed and if new issues come up.",3

13685,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Edit: They added the feature. - I have one suggestion.  Add the ability for a daily journal under each habit. The ability to add a small private note to a habit for that day.  Many habit experts recommend writing down thoughts/feelings when you fail.  This has many benefits for learning why we succeed and fail with our habits. Also people could add things that HabitBull might not already record.  I love this app!,5

13704,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"While the app syncs/backs up to the cloud, it's still not ideal for using with multiple devices. It'd be nice if the data was just *stored* in the cloud. I bought premium for sync, but it only gave me premium on one device, not both with the same account. What the heck? I guess you have to sync on the premium device, then log off and back on on the non-premium device. A little too social for my taste, too, but you can turn a lot of that off. They do provide good tech support. Overall, it is my favorite of the habbit apps I've tried so far. Still has some improvements that could be done. Would really like to see better support for accumulative (saving money, completing a series, etc) or one-time goals.",3

14013,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Ive tried a bunch of 'habit trackers'.. this is by far the easiest to use right from the star. Great to look at and actual options for how you want to track each item (everyday or specific days was what I was looking for). The others I have tried were either everyday or you broke your streak.,5

I set up the widget so it only takes a few seconds each day to check the list off (each time's like a little pat on the back) Before you know it you realise that you've kept up doing things every day and you've got a long satisfying chain to prove it.

There is a list view (also where you add habits) a weekly view, a monthly view.  There are options for what a success/fail day will look like (colors or checks and x-es). There is a range option if you want to see how well you do during a particular set length of time.  There are color-coding options, category options, sorting options (altho, there could be more sorting options - the apps default is by score, the only other sort option is manual where you hold the list item down and drag it in the order you want.  I'd like to see other auto sorting options like, longest to shortest streak, etc).  Best of all, this app doesn't try to WOW the user with bells & whistles and flashy design.  All the stats are listed at the bottom of the weekly view, at the bottom of monthly view you can see the stats on a particular habit.

I either feel guilt or great but at least I know where I stand.  If I miss one day, I try to catch up the next day.  I love the simplicity.  Highly recommended.",5
14238,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Excellent habit builder and tracker. I love the reminder options. You can set it to go on bugging you until you bother doing the task, so you get both a nagging reminder, and incentive to keep recording your progress. The numerical goals are brilliant, especially in combination with the repeating reminders. I set it to ask every 2 hours about smoking, so if I have a cigarette I don't need to bother recording it in real time, but just add +1 (or +2) when the app next asks me. Most convenient habit app!",5

14471,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Love this one! Needs some more attention.,5
14472,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Like what I see so far. But when i tried to buy premium, it would not allow me to choose the Google account where I have play balance/credit, even though the account is set up using that Google account. I have switched Google accounts to use the play balance with other apps. Emailed the support but no response after almost 4 days now. I need more than 5 habits. Maybe should look for other apps.",3
14473,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I have emailed support a few times to get my account back after switching phones but they will not answer. I'm being asked to pay another fee to upgrade. I will email support again and then do a charge back on my credit card. And I will file a complaint with Google and Apple store. Buy at your own risk because support does not respond.,1
14474,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,The app is very helpful but it's ability to easily enter time as a tracked stat is lacking.  If I want to work on time management it would nice to be able to record and average when I say I did something over a period of time.  Also for units it would nice to have a set of nicely formatted options and then a choose you own option at the bottom.,4
14475,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Downloaded it with high hopes of it helping me overcome my addictions. Noticed today that with each habit, there is a section of quotes from other users that are ""related"" to your habit. The quotes I read were highly innapropriate, against my morals, and had every swear word in the book, including the F word. Sex talk was also big in the quotes. As soon as I saw this, this app was deleted from my phone. I will use only Habit Streak from now on, and I hope for the sake of future users that HabitBull changes.",1
14476,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Just a couple minutes ago I saw it had made a notification saying something to the effect of ""Don't forget to use HabitBull daily!"" I immediately opened the app to check the setting because just two days ago I specifically set the option ""Remind me to use HabitBull?"" to ""No"". And sure enough it was set to ""No"" now! Yet it gave me this stupid notification! Very intrusive! I hope it's an unintended mistake on the programmers' part and not a gross attempt to keep their app in the user's attention.",2
14477,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Almost 3 years ago I liked it enough to purchase it. Then they decided to make it a monthly fee. I found this out when I reloaded it onto my phone. I emailed them to find out if my previous purchase was valid or if it was applicable to the new version and they never responded. Even a simple ""no"" would have been fine. So, I found another habit tracker that I actually prefer.",2
14478,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Such a fraud this app is !  I paid for premium upgrade, the amount gets deducted from my account, and then nothing happens - I followed steps in the  FAQ section, nothing happened, except my previous list also did not get synced. Of course, the customer support hasn't responded in days, and now, I find that there are many who have faced the same issue as I have. In conclusion, please avoid !",1
14479,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"If you want to track more than 5 habits, you'll have to pay for the premium app. I appreciate that they want to make money, but it would have been nice to know this up front instead of downloading the app, starting to set things up and being thwarted before you even begin. Very frustrating and enough so that I've uninstalled the app and will look elsewhere.",2
14480,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Im still hoping the reviews weren't true but am now realizing the are. I 
was kicked out of the app after it froze and it's asking me to log in 
again. It's not accepting any of my credentials which are correct. I am 
upset because I paid for the premium service and now I can't use it. I just 
now realized the same thing happened to me when I switched phones a year 
ago and I reached out to them with no response. I had to purchase the app 
again, retype all my habita and look my data. I'll be switching apps not 
worth the hassle and money. A shame because I did enjoy it while it worked.",1
14481,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Please add Label feature to group up the habits, its feel so uncomfortable to scroll down if i have so much habits, and add reward feature like achievements we can share or something like Rewire's features. Make the design more simple and effective, it will be good too Im going to upgrade premium soon, thanks",3
14482,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I wanted to like this app. The ui is good and it's feature rich. It's been installed for a couple of hours now and it already will not launch. I see they have issues with older phones, but I'm on an LG G2 and have zero issues running the most modern and demanding apps. This app needs work.",2
14483,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Not gonna make this too long. I'm trying to make some good habits. I failed a few, but some are sticking - I attribute this to taking on too many things at once. Find a schedule that's reasonable for you, and do one thing at a time. Habit bull will keep you on the right path",5
14484,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Instantly get disappointed after knowing only get 3 basic features, compared to premium (it also has 2 kinds of premium; standard and platinum). One of basic features is I can only add habits up to 5. Also, no cloud service.",2
14485,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,This app is so easy to use and allows me to quickly keep track of my progress. It's also motivating because once you have a streak going you don't want to break it! I highly recommend for people who either want to start a new habit or break a bad one. I'm currently doing both at the same time and it's working great so far!,5
14486,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I wish I could have had the opportunity to use it. No matter what I did, every time I would hit the, ""Tap To Dive In"" it just goes into an endless buffer and does nothing. I've tried for 2 days to get the app to let me through by logging in through Facebook or creating an account with my email. Nothing works.",1
14487,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Despite that I think this app should improve with quotes or facts about what would be the best thing to do the help with the habit for example let's say my habit I'm trying to gain is eating healthy, if connected to WiFi I feel like this app should show suggestings like drinking water leads to eating healthy foods. They app is great but that suggestion would make it perfect",5
14488,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Be careful when paying for premium, it is a bit of a scam in my experience. Had premium for around two years and then it reverted, l completed all their recommended trouble shooting which didn't work and sent them the required email. Haven't heard back from any contact for 2 months. Really dissapointed with the customer service, which is only available via a gmail account - maybe this will get their attention and they finally be bothered to reply.",1
14489,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Beware: it displays random usernames and those users habits. Huge privacy 
issue in my eyes. While my habit was simply not to lose my temper, I did 
NOT like seeing others, like ""userxyz is trying to quit horrible and 
embarrassing habit X."" I don't care to see what other folks are trying to 
quit doing, and I really don't care for others to see what I'm doing. 
Uninstalled.",1
14490,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"What's up with the dots?  I get it, but really dislike the format.  You can only view one week at a time, and forget about editing any errors.  The notifications were also annoying instead of being helpful.  Just not a straightforward app.  If you like screwing around on your phone, this is the habit tracker for you!  If you value your time, look elsewhere.",2
14491,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It is literally perfect for me looking at the description and screenshots in the play store. The interface is simple and everything is easy to understand; from what little I was able to play around with it, it seems like a really great app! However the loading time delay was unbearable for me. Even when scrolling down the current page, it would take about 7 seconds before finally acknowledging the gesture and scrolling. My phone isn't even that old! Really sad it didn't work for me :(",2
14492,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,An easy way to record habits and track daily streaks. Responsive and well designed. Great as a simple app for the person that just wants to track habits.,5
14493,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Everyone on this app uses it to track how long they've gone without 
masturbating or watching porn. Go see a psychologist if you can't keep your 
hands to yourself. How am I supposed to concentrate on drinking more water 
when I keep spitting out all my water laughing at this?",1
14494,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Got this app, used it for 50 days before deciding to upgrade to premium. The upgrade not only completely wiped all my data from the previous 50 days, the app doesn't recognize that I've upgraded despite the fact that my credit card has been charged for it. I've emailed the developers about this multiple times trying to get help, but they have not responded. Terrible customer service and frankly there are other tools just as good or better than this one to track habits that won't cause such a hassle or steal your money.",1

14497,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Has a 5 habits limit which makes the free version useless: just a bait and switch for the paid version. There are fully functional free tools out there which deserve the full rating: the open source ""Loop Habit"" lets me manage over 30 habits.",1
14498,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Top app. Used it for a couple of months. Proud of my progress. Users : Choose 1-3  habits and work to complete a marathon not a race. App designers: please change cheesy reminder names.,5
14499,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Why. Why would you make an app that forces me to be online to use it? Better question- why do all that JUST FOR THIS TYPE OF APP? It's not a game, or a GPS service, why the hell do you need access to my Identity AND I have to have an account created just to basically put a check mark on the day? There's no good reason. Try ""7 Weeks"" app or any of the other top 11 apps that DON'T REQUIRE you to have an account/Internet to use them and chew through your data.",1
14500,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"Pros. 1. Simple interface for adding habits. 2. They appreciate the not every day to many times a day nature of habits, 3. Very visual and ideal for an phone format. 4. Making habits a game!  Con. 1. Nag screen that wants my email, twitter or Facebook details just three habits in...  I would be very content to give feedback after a useful period of use with a number of habits ( eg a few weeks, and, as in the middle of a mid-life-crisis I have a few more than three habits that need changing.)    2. The ability to add sub categories? e.g. for me under health and fitness I'd want sleep, not sure how this would affect any habit score or aggregation .  So - Three stars (middle) due to lack of use.  [Maybe they caught me on a bad day.]",3
14501,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,Exactly what I was looking for. Enjoy it a lot. Yes you could make a shoddy excel sheet and manually track all of these things like I was doing before but it was a pain and I found myself not using it and skipping days. This is a packaged up version that is convenient on your phone and pops up with reminders you can set so you don't forget to mark things. I would buy this again. I bought the premium version because I like to track a crazy amount of things.,5
14502,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I purchased an upgrade, still no reminders.  No one responded to my emails.  Loved it for the 7 days it worked.",1
14503,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,This app was great to use up until my lifetime membership that I paid for suddenly didn't exist anymore. Contacting developers over email did nothing to fix the situation as no one ever responded. Really disappointing.,1
14504,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,I like the innovative idea of getting reminded to do important things. But not like this... It has a very confusing layout and did not help me too much.,2
14505,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"I was surprised to be limited to only 5 habits. Having features like cloud storage and syncing locked, not a problem or a surprise.  I've uninstalled and won't be using what looked to be a promising app. :(      I'm willing to note that *maybe* I missed the sentence in the description​, even after reading it twice, stating a restriction on the number of habits trackable at a time.",2
14506,com.oristats.habitbull,A Google user,"It is a generally good application but the excesses advertisements can get annoying along with the application not allowing for more than a set amount of habits.

home screen widgets, so I kicked in a few dollars and bought the premium 
subscription. Not long after, I was unable to log in with my premium 
account. All attempts at troubleshooting failed. I even sent an email to 
their support with screenshots of my receipts, and got no reply after 
months of waiting. I recommend going elsewhere for your habit tracking; 
there's no guarantee these developers will honour the premium services you 
bought. Feel like I got ripped off. :(",1
