0,kolmachikhin.alexander.breakbadhabits,Jared McFarland,"Pretty good and simple app for tracking a bad habit :) I will say though that often times the ""name of habit"" will display on a widget, but the ""time since"" will not display unless I adjust the size bigger and then back to small (1√ó2). Not sure what is causing that :/ Also one thing I would like to see added is options for the widget to make it look a bit nicer; like maybe having the habit icon on it somewhere, or some centering. Maybe the option to display the habit icon instead of the name",4
1,kolmachikhin.alexander.breakbadhabits,Pedram Hashemi,"Decent app, but I see great potential here! I have many auggestions for your app: 1. the ability to change the order of habits in app 2. categorizing habits can also be grat 3. add colors to logos of habits! they will make the app more aesthetically pleasing. 4. people may wants to not seeing the name of their habits on widget (may be they are ashamed of the habit and afraid other people see them) add a feature to hide or change the name on widget. 5. backup! Great app btw. Thank you.",4
2,kolmachikhin.alexander.breakbadhabits,Sandra Tewson,There's no motivation to help you achieve your goal and nothing to support how well you're doing if you are achieving. It's a little unsatisfying actually - no sense of accomplishment.,2
3,kolmachikhin.alexander.breakbadhabits,Yj gg,It is an awesome app but wish some improvements to be made to be perfect! 1. Backup: will be very demotivated and upset if currently running stopwatch get reset or lose all my abstinence records. I am planning to use this app for years and wish all the records(efforts) I will make to be saved safely and can be seen on the graph. 2. Widget design&color... please!! 3. Widget to be automatically refreshed every minute. 4. the time spent on the addiction not to be included in the abstinence time.,5
4,kolmachikhin.alexander.breakbadhabits,Savannah Sexton,"Simplistic. Does what would be needed. With the free version you can just have 2 habits and just see how long since you last broke them. If you want the statistics and calendar stuff shown in their pictures, you have to pay $0.99 for the full version (one time).",4
5,kolmachikhin.alexander.breakbadhabits,Val Rose,"Edit: THANK YOU to the creator for updating it and enabling editing the Abstinence time period! This app is absolutely perfect and amazing now!!! üòäüíïüëç Old review: I really love this app! I paid for the full version which was like $2.00 oneoff~ Its perfect and simplistic, exactly what I was looking for. It's brilliant and much better than other breaking habits apps. And it has icons for each habit that you can edit~ I love it lol Highly recommend~",5
