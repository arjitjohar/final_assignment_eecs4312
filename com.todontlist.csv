0,com.todontlist,WebSam,I randomly read the book and saw the app mentioned. Thebgreat thing is you don't need to have read the book to use the app. It's a super simple idea. The lack of features is a positive in my opinion. I use it to prioritise what I work on each day. Thanks for creating this.,5
1,com.todontlist,Iain Forsyth,"I got this after reading the book, and it makes a lot of sense why ToDont's are put in ToDo (everything is a ToDo until more than 4 are there, then it populates the ToDon't list). The UI could be a bit more intuitive though",4
2,com.todontlist,H G,This app is just what I needed. However I have noticed it has not been updated in a few years. It works but feels a little off at times I am willing to buy a paid version. Keep up the great work!,5
3,com.todontlist,Ivan Fedaka,"Idea is awesome, but implementation is not. Unfortunately quite often there is no keyboard when I try to add new item.",1
4,com.todontlist,A Google user,"Frustrating, to dont list items appeared in to do list, no select all function on text, uninstalled and gave up, easier to write in a note on phone",2
5,com.todontlist,Larissa Lopes,"Simple and effective, just the necessary.",5
6,com.todontlist,R Z,Puts todonts into the todo list.,1
