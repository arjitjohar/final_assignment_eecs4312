0,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,I love this app. I was getting tired of going through so many to-do apps that made me go mad through all the features and options etc. I would like to suggest a few things for next updates. I'd like to be able to quantify or copy certain tasks. Also changing their order would be good. Sorting alphabetically. Keep up the good work! Beautiful UI.,4
1,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,"I really like the app (very clean design and very simple usage) but there are neither reminders nor recurring tasks. That's so sad, since the app's description describes this features as part of the app. The ""task to complete"" amount doesn't work. When I complete tasks the counter still shows the total amount of all task, not completed as well as completed. I am looking forward for updates. Edit: the add button hides the task at the right bottom so you can't done it.",2
2,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,"Ok, super minimal - interface very similar to writing sticky notes. 4 stars because I can't drag/drop to re-order the way I see the tasks. I'm not sure how to set reminders and I really don't see any added list functionality in addition to the sticky note user interface. Otherwise, great looking and easy to use app.",4
3,com.app.nexdo,Manuela G.D,"Been using -and uninstalling- many to-do's app for a couple of years and hands down this is the best I came across: simple and very light in space, AND includes a dark mode. Plus, no ads included. Can't wrap my mind that is free. I do keep writing my to-do's in paper because I didn't find any app that convinced me. Here you got me, thanks, amazing app!! Still figuring out how to change the 'Hey, friend' for my name 😅",5
4,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,"I am liking this app. However I don't think it has all the features, it says it has. For eg. I could not find - Sub-tasks, Daily /Weekly Planner, Next 7 Days calendar view, Add due dates to your to-do list with calendar scheduler, Add priority, Karma points, Trends. Currently, I can only, Add/edit/remove a task, Mark/unmark task completed, Move task to notification bar, Count no. of characters, Dark mode. That's it! Am I missing something?",3
5,com.app.nexdo,Akash Das,"A beautifully designed app which has many useful features! Kudos to the dev for keeping it free without any ads. Above all a clean experience, which a user desires. I'd like to request you to add a feature to input due date, just a personal preference.",5
6,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,"+/- Very simplistic, when in the app you can add an item, and see the current list of items. - items added sometimes appeared twice - no archive, no way to restore a previously completed task (even when deleted accidentally) - several items I needed simply disappeared (this was a serious problem that day) - all items are current, for today. - No way to add an item for tomorrow or another time. I have uninstalled it.",3
7,com.app.nexdo,Wattanakarn Vladimirova,"Minimalist app created by genius :) Well, how did the developer managed to cram into the application size of 1.5M such a necessary and sufficient functionality? In general, I will be brief - if you have a lot of small and large cases, a good third of which you are constantly forgetting, the application will really help you. Very nice application interface - all these cool animated animals look very funny and modern.",5
8,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,"This is probably the best ToDo list I have ever downloaded it does not have in-app purchases, there is no ads and the best function of all it just works! But of course every app has it's downsides 1. I would like to have task groups so I can organise my tasks and 2. Making tasks is a bit confusing",5
9,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,It is best ever interface I have experience so far ... of any thing that lists to-do(s) ... means ... sometimes you just want to remember that you got a something to do ... not when this dumb thing has to be done! ... The interface is asthetically minimal ... only necessory configuration ... (only turn-into-dark theme option) ... One thing ... I would die for it ... if it had only a widget thingy on my cute phone ... Ahh!,5
10,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,"Could use recurring tasks, but other than that the simplistic design of this app is perfect. (Edit: Okay well it looks like the app is in early stages. I'm excited for the features described in the description).",5
11,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,"Too basic. There isnt much difference from this app and me just writing stuff to do on paper. I wish it would have a way to set reminders and maybe add countdown timers for tasks. What's included in the app works well, but there could be so much more.",2
12,com.app.nexdo,Reybhan April Panti,"I really love this sleek, minimalist app although it lacks a lot features like reminder, sub-task, and notes. It would be great if the developers can add these features. Can you make a pro version of this app where the tasks can be access on locked screen? I would definitely invest on this with that feature.",3
13,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,"Nexdo is a simple and a nice app to add tasks. I just totally love the UI. I have rated only 3 stars bcoz, i would be good if the app has an option to add note on each task and a automatic reminder option... Hope to see these add-ons in the next update.",3
14,com.app.nexdo,Jonathan Marshall,"It's super SIMPLE and that is all I wanted. I see people complaining it doesn't have X, Y, or Z. ""Might as well use paper."" Are you carrying a notepad on you? Me neither. So I have this. It's just SIMPLE. It's just a to-do list. No accounts. No ads. No complex setups. I love it.",5
15,com.app.nexdo,Daniil Tsivinsky,"It is a very cool and simple todo app but also it has own problems. For example, splash screen is not a svg icon and it resizes on start. Also, it will be good to make background color in dark theme lighter, more greyish. But thanks for simple todo application.",4
16,com.app.nexdo,Alexandra Hindley,"Just enjoy using and it's easy to use. If I've got a lot that needs doing I put them in Nexdo and then spin , stop and whatever I land on well that's the chore I do. It stopped me getting overwhelmed with everything that needs doing. Now I have one a day and Nexdo picks it for me. It's so easy to use. There's no faffing about you write what you want to do then tick off when you finished particular job. Really happy with it my fave app",5
17,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,Great app. Love the simplicity and design. Problem is adding text based todo. I have to hit back icon to add the task which is annoying can there be a better way to do this.,5
18,com.app.nexdo,shivam kedar,Loved 90% of the app.. but I'd suggest few improvements which will make the app perfect for me 1. Sorting the tasks in order 2. Making it easy to check the boxes by increasing the size of the tick box maybe..,4
19,com.app.nexdo,Mayur Gadhiya,No doubt that the UI is great in this app but functionality is trash. I can just add tasks and that's all this app does. I can't even delete my previously added tasks. I can't categories my tasks and order them as i need. Overall it looked like alpha version of any to-do list apps. Need to add a lot features.,1
20,com.app.nexdo,Matt Cooper,"Simple. Clean. Effective. It does what I need it to do, in an aesthetically appealing manner, without all the clunky ""features"" that other apps have. Well done",5
21,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,"Lovely interface, really easy to use. I wish there was an option to add a home screen widget but other than that, probably the best to-do list app I have used.",5
22,com.app.nexdo,Nazmeen Sk,"I loved it's simplicity but for some reason, I cannot add it as widget on my home screen. I've used a fair amount of to do apps and they all had widget feature no matter how bad they were.",4
23,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,"As of now the appearance is great, No Sub-Task or Date/Time settings, Restore completed, Advanced features, Sharing, Web Interface, Folders etc. But Love the crisp text style... Lot to come.",3
24,com.app.nexdo,Ashwin Kumar,"A widget would be much more appreciated, I was looking for an app which is clean and minimal and this app is exactly what I needed but then I noticed it doesn't have a widget which was very big turn off, Please add widget.",3
25,com.app.nexdo,nova somar,clean and beautiful UI Suggestions for future updates : 1 .Possibility of manually arraging the tabs 2 . Account syncing for backup,5
26,com.app.nexdo,Avril Erin,"The simple to-do list. Suggestions for next update, add on editing pencil to avoid accidentally delete the notes; add on bold, italic, underline and strike through function are better.",4
27,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,The UI is good but the current app description is a lie. You can't make a list or add notes. There are no reminders as well.,3
28,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,Sleek Design. Minimalistic with integral features. Long Tap to Activate Voice to Text. Couldn't have asked for anything better.,5
29,com.app.nexdo,Junaid Bhat,"It is really Useful. I was always frustrated by Other Apps by their hours,progress charts,blah blah blah. On this App, I found Simplicity. I am really getting things done.",5
30,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,Overall the app is too good. It has a simple interface which I like. The only problem it has is it doesn't allow to mention time and day to the task. 🙂,4
31,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,It's really simple and easy to use. No bothering for sign in stuff. Just simple and nice. Great work dev. Is it built using flutter don't know but it seems like one made out of flutter..,5
32,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,"Simple and Sweet. :D Please add support for syncing across devices, and the ability to add subtasks.",5
33,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,Everything is beautifully designed. It is simple yet effective. The only issue I have is that reordering is not possible. Really hope that we will be able to reorder the list in the next update. Love it!,4
34,com.app.nexdo,Udai tiwari,Simple and to the point. Gives a block view of tasks. Can add tasks by Google speech. I use it for everyday tasks.,5
35,com.app.nexdo,Shashank Srivastava,"This is the best to do list app. Most simplest, easiest. No adds, no unwanted options. Really appriciate this kind of work...👍",5
36,com.app.nexdo,SANIYA JAVED,"clean app..no unnecessary features,easy to use. but it can have category option to categorize the task.it would be more good.",4
37,com.app.nexdo,Shrihari,The best todo every other todo are complex and add so many things not needed Nexdo is perfect I hope you keep the same simplicity and minimalist.,5
38,com.app.nexdo,Rυƈԋι Sιɳɠԋαɳια,"Well, u know it is a nice but it should have like date and timing adjustments. Like if i want to do a task on some specific date or tomorrow, maybe, it should have date and timing thingies with reminders..",3
39,com.app.nexdo,Sreejita Sarkar,"App is nice but when I am creating the to do list, then it is showing the same task again and again. Hope that this problem would be fixed in the future.",2
40,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,I first wrote a task then when I added another task after tapping it was showing the right name but from out side it was showing the name same as the other task. Pathetic app!!!,1
41,com.app.nexdo,Tanish Pashte,"Personally liked this app a lot after trying so much apps. Quite simple. Loved the minimal UI. Just one thing: PLEASE ADD A FEATURE TO SEPARATE COMPLETED TASKS. By the way, great job devs....❤️",4
42,com.app.nexdo,Rajat Singh,"Super Simple, Clean and Minimalistic. No freaking ads, just all I needed for so long!",5

46,com.app.nexdo,Angela Hernan,"i would love to rate this five stars but i won't since it doesn't have a schedule option/deadline but it has a pretty ui, definitely recommending this app to my friends and btw if you would make another app pls make it a pomodoro timer",4
47,com.app.nexdo,Tplay Monteiro,"Perfect, simple, light and easy interface no complaints at all Anxious for next app from the developers",5
48,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,Best To-Do List app! If you want to set notifications hold down the task. :) It is written in the settings.,5
49,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,All is good but would be a lot better if when I tick a task then at the top it will says ___ out of ___ tasks are left/remaining. It would be satisfying to watch,3
50,com.app.nexdo,A Google user,Elegant and super clean to use. Adding support for adaptive icon would be better though.,4
51,com.app.nexdo,Sharath S,"excellent app but needs to add new features soon, and I'm pretty sure I saw a ""hide completed tasks"" button before and it was very useful but now I can't find it",3
52,com.app.nexdo,7 Bangtan Disaster,It is good but when i finish my task and then delete it then I continually going back on my home screen Idk why it happened but still its really a awesome app I love it ♡,4

56,com.app.nexdo,Sejal Yadav,Best app for making to do list I don't know why people use notion and todoist and fill storage this app better than all apps and it is of only 2 mb means it does not take that much space.,5
