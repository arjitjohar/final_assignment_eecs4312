com.iojess.todont&pli=1,To Don't - Break Bad Habits,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iojess.todont&pli=1,"To Don't is the opposite of a to-do list, it's a to-don't list. Create a list of things you want to avoid doing and when you shouldn't do them:

‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Don't eat dessert on Tuesday
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Don't wake up late Monday-Friday
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Don't cry while watching the news

Things like that.

Answer daily questions to track your progress. Motivate yourself to break bad habits by building streaks over time. View your activity history to better understand your behavior.

Not all days are the same. Customize your day by specifying which questions appear on which days of the week. Going on vacation? Pause your questions until you're ready to resume them.

To Don't is a simple and straightforward tool to help break bad habits, stop addiction, or simply make small improvements to your life."
com.todontlist,ToDon‚ÄôtList,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todontlist,"Creative people have many things to do and even more ideas. But most of these never get done, and even brilliant ideas never see the light of day. Why? If you ask a creative person, the answer will always revolve around time. We simply need time to execute an idea (and do it well)‚Äîmore time than we have.

The ToDon‚ÄôtList App supports you in making the hardest choices: what will and won‚Äôt you do.

‚Äî How it works
You have 3 lists ‚Äî a Do list, a Done list, ‚Äãand a ToDon‚ÄôtList. You can only put 3 items on your Do list. The rest of your to-dos automatically go on your ToDon‚ÄôtList.

When you‚Äôve finished a task, the corresponding to-do will be transferred to your Done list (giving a nice sense of accomplishment). This will leave space for a new item on your Do list, which will be added from your ToDon‚ÄôtList.

Tasks remaining on your ToDon‚ÄôtList for longer than 3 months automatically disappear, without notification. After all, if they had been important enough, you would have done something about them by that time.


‚Äî Background
Once a psychologist was invited to the Pentagon to give a workshop to generals on time management. He asked the group to each write down in 25 words what their strategy had been so far for managing their time.

Nearly all generals already hit a wall there. 25 words were too little. The only one who succeeded in completing the task was the only female general at the gathering. She came up with the following strategy: ‚ÄúFirst I make a list of priorities: one, two, three, and so on. Then I cross out everything from three downwards.‚Äù

What the general had done was turn her to-dos into to-don‚Äôts. She placed all her to-dos on a to-don‚Äôt list and only chose three to-dos to complete. Anything below the line would simply not get done. This gave her more time to do those 3 things well.

Just like the general, you can only place three items on your DoList. The other items stay on your ToDon‚ÄôtList.

This general‚Äôs method is a simple, but an extremely effective way of making choices. It inspired this app, which in turn inspired a book (‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Read This Book, Time Management for Creative People‚Äô)."

Visually showing the progress of the fight against bad habits, this is something that constantly eludes us when we want to break the addiction. And here's how exactly it is achieved:

üìïÔ∏è Habit Management
You can create any bad habit, set an icon for it and the time from which the abstinence countdown will start.

üïìÔ∏è Timer for every habit
Under each habit there is a timer that counts down the time since the last habit event every second!

üóìÔ∏è Habit Event Calendar
Each event is marked in the calendar of events - this is very convenient and clearly shows how often events occur during the month.

üìäÔ∏è Abstinence Schedule
Shows with the help of columns intervals of abstinence. This makes it easy to estimate how long you can roughly last without a habit. And it is also a very good motivation to increase the time of abstinence. It's a shame when the chart goes down, and it's nice to see it go up.

üßÆÔ∏è Habit Statistics
The most interesting indicators are indicated in the statistics:
- Average abstinence time
- Maximum abstinence time
- Minimum abstinence time
- Time since first habit event
- Number of habit events in the current month
- Number of habit events in the past month
- Total number of habit events

üì≤Ô∏è Home screen widget with habits
For widgets, you can customize the title and specific habits that will be shown in it. Thanks to him, on the main screen, you will be met every time with progress in your habits and give you more motivation!"

It's a habit breaker app that aims to help users overcome self-harming or addictive behavior and stop bad habits.

Rewards.
The rewards feature is actually a calculation of the money saved. For example, if you‚Äôve spent $100 on gambling weekly, and you haven‚Äôt gambled for a week, then those $100 is your weekly reward. Users can also manually add rewards for themselves. This serves as great motivation to quit alcohol, cigarettes, junk food, or anything similar that costs us money and is harmful to our body and health.
