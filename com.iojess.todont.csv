0,com.iojess.todont,Jay Robson,"No ads, which is amazing. Also I can earn colourful streaks :) def a good way to do things like ""stop skin picking"" as it's good at getting you to be aware of it daily to build a habit of it and not just forget about your goals to stop. Also I think ads would def be a major detraction from this app, as it's based off of things being satisfying, yk getting that dopamine running, and I hate seeing ads lol so thanks for not adding ads ‚ô•Ô∏è",5
1,com.iojess.todont,Kelly S,"Awesome!! Thank you so much! Would love to see someday the ability to change colors, put certain habits on hold (hide them), set notifications on a per-habit basis. Agree with other users requesting a widget and more options for habit frequency.",5
