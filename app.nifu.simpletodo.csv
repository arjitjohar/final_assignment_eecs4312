0,app.nifu.simpletodo,Kat,"This app is absolutely fantastic. It helps me keep track of things, it has ZERO ads, and it's so simple and sleek! My whole life I've been searching for a nice digital list maker and all the time they are so crowded and overloaded with unecessary stickers or gadgets and I don't need that! This app is so simple and nice and it is exactly what I've always needed and wanted! :))",5
1,app.nifu.simpletodo,Linda Benjamin,"Brilliant, EXCEPT for the colour scheme. Grey text is hard to read, whether it's on a black background or on a white background. I love that I can move tasks up and down according to their priority and I love that it looks a bit like a post-it program, only simpler and free. Other than that I love it, but I don't know if the developers will read this and change it.",5
2,app.nifu.simpletodo,Tom√°≈° ≈†edoviƒç,This app does actually what it needs to in the simplest way possible: add items to a list one by one. Then cross them out. It's baking how many other apps require you to go through a separate dialog window every time you want to add an entry to the shopping list. The only annoying thing is the absence of a paid ad-free version.,5
3,app.nifu.simpletodo,TheAspect OfSnow,"Love it ! This will truly sound insane, but this is the only app, that just lets me write down things and then delete them when they are done. It does not provide me with random statistics, that nobody needs and does not try to access my photos or phonenumbers. How is it possible that every Interface in 2022 is just an Overkill? Thanks a lot for exactly what i needed. An Option to pay to get rid of ad would be appreciated.",5
4,app.nifu.simpletodo,semih,"I really like the app! But I have some feedback that would make my experience much better: 1. When adding items to a list, the added item always gets added to the top of the list. I'd like for items to get added on the bottom. 2. Because I really like the app, I'd even pay money to get an ad-free version. Please consider making one :D ! Thank you for making the app! I really like it!",4
5,app.nifu.simpletodo,Lush Ann,"I've been using this app for a month now and it does it job perfectly most of the time. It's simple and easy to use. The ads are not invasive and it just stays at the bottom, no problem. I rated this app a 4/5 because when I rearrange my tasks, it sometimes goes back to the original place. Hopefully, the devs can fix this. It's a minor issue, but I want to prioritize my tasks.",4
6,app.nifu.simpletodo,Kathleen Inna Bay,"Great app, minimalist design, does the job, not complicated to use, and the app does not crash. i suggest that there will be a reminder option where it can pop up on the screen so it wouldn't be a hassle to open the app check the tasks",4
7,app.nifu.simpletodo,Chimik Chimik,It's very easy to use. For lovers of minimalism or just lovers of clear interface. The only issue I've found there are ad's I'd like to have a possibility to remove them like for exp. paying 2-5$ would beanice way to support a creator + to get rid of those ads !,5
8,app.nifu.simpletodo,Kathulhu _,"Very slow to load. All other apps on my phone load in less than a second. This takes a full 10 seconds of staring at a white screen. Fine once opened, but not handy at all.",2
9,app.nifu.simpletodo,Mark Singh (Amarpal),"simple, easy, minimalist - it's exactly what I need with no extra nonsense that gets in the way. **Update (Oct. 7th, 2022): still using it, and would gladly pay for an ad-free version",5
10,app.nifu.simpletodo,Shrikrishna Shanbhag,"Clean, simple , effective. Would recommend to anyone looking for minimalistic approach to planning their day. Not sure whether they have a windows app or website as well. But that would be dope.",5
11,app.nifu.simpletodo,Maria Mylenka,"Working great so far! Very straightforward, intuitive and minimal (no unnecessary design or functions). Made my obsession with making to-do lists way more organized - less papers all around my workspace & elsewhere üëç",5
12,app.nifu.simpletodo,Sean Roekens,"Simple. Other To-do list apps flood me with notifications, reminders, and constant nagging. It stresses me out. This one is extremely simple to use and does exactly what I want: it's a to-do list. Nothing more. Exactly how I want it. Thank you.",5
13,app.nifu.simpletodo,Chateau Baylor,"Great design, layout, and concept, but there are many things missing as a to-do list. The most important is when is it due? As a to-do list it must have that at the very least. Besides that, reminders would be good as well, as well as a subnote and priority feature. A calendar can be added as well, and I know that this is supposed to be a minimalistic app, but it's almost a must have for a to-do list app. Right now, while this app's concept is great, it's a note app more than anything.",4
14,app.nifu.simpletodo,Mateja Milenkovic,"Currently using Stuff, but if this app gets widget like Stuff has, would easily switch to this app since it has backup option which I am missing currently in Stuff. Also, if I can sync, for example, ""Grocery list"", with my wife who owns iPhone, that would be awesome! (Would pay for paid version for this feauture + to get rid of the ads)",4
15,app.nifu.simpletodo,Britney Knobbe,"I've been using this app for months and I love it. Perfect for all shopping and to-do lists! I simply check and uncheck items as needed after making daily, weekly, monthly and grocery lists. Adding or deleting items only takes a second and I love how clean and user friendly it is.",5
16,app.nifu.simpletodo,random potato,I like how simple and easy to use it is..ive tried so many apps but i kept this one only. I use it for my everyday schedules however i wish you added a folder creating option so we could categorize the listsü•≤,4
17,app.nifu.simpletodo,Rohan Pattar,"An amazing experience! Unlike many other apps I've tried in the past (which show many charts of statistics that are not even necessary), this one is simple and straightforward.",5
18,app.nifu.simpletodo,Rukmal Ranaweera,It's simple & easy. The only issue I have is this doesn't sync data among devices. We need to just backup and restore them manually. üòï,4
19,app.nifu.simpletodo,Banana Lol,"It's a very great app! I was looking for an app which alows me to do as many lists I want, and also a simple one. This app is just like that! I really love the dark theme as well, and overall it has a modern look (which matters a lot for me). So, really satisfied. Highly recommended!",5
20,app.nifu.simpletodo,LISA CATTABRIGA,"app is just what I needed: simple, can make multiple lists with titles that stand out, and are very responsive and functional. Atul Gawande would be proud!",4
21,app.nifu.simpletodo,Alfa Ranken,"Everything on my list just disappeared. Very frustrating! Need to log in & give access to Google acct to make backup, which I didn't do, so my list is gone. Going back to Google notes. Needs an easy save, backup/restore, export function, and a search function.",2
22,app.nifu.simpletodo,Pink Lady,I love this. Its so easy to use. No messing about. You can make many different lists. It's easy to use and I used have 5 or 6 apps just to make enough lists but I can now have everything and anything on one app. That's what I like about it. Cause sometimes you have to faff about just to read what's on each list. Now it's all under one app.,5
23,app.nifu.simpletodo,Tanja Prini,"Great app! I like the minimalist and easy to use interface. The only things missing would be the possibility to create recurring tasks, also being able to copy a list as text would be nice but other than that it's great!",5
24,app.nifu.simpletodo,dhiraj chauhan,"Its just the right combination of useful features and clean and minimal design. But, is missing a widget and also lacks an auto update which would have made it that much more handy. Note to devolopers: please provide a widget and auto update option.",4
25,app.nifu.simpletodo,Pranab,"Beautiful and fast! Just wish it had nested tasks and tags. Nested tasks can be created/'uncreated' just by holding and dragging left/right, and tags would be a little more complicated, like a drop-down or pop-up menu. I'm in love, but I need those features ;p",5
26,app.nifu.simpletodo,Kryz,"If you're a minimalist like me then this app is for you, the design and overall aesthetic sticks to their name, it's just ""simple"". But I personally think, this app could improve, specifically on this buttons. There's too many buttons for adding subtasks and notes",5
27,app.nifu.simpletodo,Aleem Khan,Very simple yet graceful app. Tried a lot of other todolist app but never felt much satisfied. The one screen Multi-view feature particularly distinguishes it in the competition. Very interactive colours and friendly interface. Highly recommended.,5
28,app.nifu.simpletodo,akhilesh verma,"Should have feature to make copy List to create tasks that are repeated daily, so that we don't have to type them again and again. Wrap text is missing. timer is missing. Overall app is light and feels easy to use.",4
29,app.nifu.simpletodo,triziecheeze,"This app is absolutely useful and aestethic. I think it would be much better if you could like add widgets, so the tasks would be much more easier to view, since you wouldn't have to open the app itself.",5
30,app.nifu.simpletodo,Alex K.,"This app have the most simple UI so is perfect for managing project for busy people who doesn't want distraction. Also one suggestion for the devs, there's just only one function missing when you cannot add reminder when it's actually the most important. Besides that, the app is still over the top though.",5
31,app.nifu.simpletodo,Revv BeKindTo,"Not bad. Only major issue is that it puts new items at the TOP of my list, instead of at the bottom. No option to switch this. UPDATE: app has massive amounts of trackers on it. Not a fan of this simple app trying to id my router/cable modem.",1
32,app.nifu.simpletodo,Maria Barbosa,I love it. Been using this for months now. Its simple. I love the cat illustration. I think the option for sorting to new automatically would've been nice so that it saves you time in scrolling down and dragging the recent list up top.,5
33,app.nifu.simpletodo,Adina Astra,I love it. Been looking for an app that doesn't cross completed items out. But with such a clear and minimal design there should be an option of an in-built purchase that turns off the ads,4
34,app.nifu.simpletodo,Just Me,"The best and simplest Todo and list maker. Clean UI and thankfully a new item is added to the top of the list. Having tried a multitude of Todo and list makers, this is now the only one I need and use. Thank you to the developer.",5
35,app.nifu.simpletodo,Richard JE Cooke,"Perfect, except for the unobtrusive adverts. I'd prefer to pay once off, but prefer adverts over a subscription model. EDIT dropping to 4 stars because it opens very slowly - maybe because it has to download an ad each time? Makes it a little unpleasant to use",4
36,app.nifu.simpletodo,Angela,"I really like this app. It's simple and gets the job done, also very efficient to use. I wish there was an option to pay to get rid of ads though for a cleaner experience. Definitely recommend regardless.",4
37,app.nifu.simpletodo,Vansh Kapoor,Hi I love the UI but tryna darken the Tasks' font colors on the main/starts-up screen. Besides that the app is wonderful. I loved it <3 (: PS: Side advice tryna add the completion dates too! Maybe a calendar or something,5
38,app.nifu.simpletodo,Elisha Elena,Easy to use. So usefull. It feels satisfiying when clicking the tick button when i finished a task. Suggestion: A choice of Fullscreen ads and Below device ads. Thank you developers üåº‚ú®‚ù§,5
39,app.nifu.simpletodo,Ken Parsons,"It would be great if ToDo could be integrated with Calendar so that by means of an option, a selected to-do item could be inserted by date and time into Calendar. If a to-do item is not scheduled to Calendar, it simply remains on the list until completed.",4
40,app.nifu.simpletodo,Rishi Bhargawa,I was looking for something simple to manage my daily tasks and didn't want to go to those very flashy apps because they are too much for an app that has a simple use for many people..... Thanks to this I won't have to look for any other app as it fulfills my needs.,5
41,app.nifu.simpletodo,Charles Chetwynd,"Fantastic app! Absolutely love it!! A few new features I'd like, would be: Widgets for Android home screen and also a way to remove the ads (wouldn't mind if I had to pay!)",5
42,app.nifu.simpletodo,Shankar Sharma,"Excellent simple app. I have been Checklist App for q while, but have switched to this. If they make some features, this would be absolutely the best To Do and Project management app!!",5
43,app.nifu.simpletodo,Daniel Takacs,"It is indeed simple, but amazing. Because of it's simplicity it's totally free. No bs ""pay to write more characters"" or ""pay to unlock subtasks"". Love it. And all of the other apps too",5
44,app.nifu.simpletodo,safiyyah,"This is exactly what I've been looking for. Simple clean layout, super easy to use and access. No fuss üòÄ",5
45,app.nifu.simpletodo,Paulina M,"Simple and nice app, great job! Would you like to add tasks headings so we could group them inside lists, e.g in the case of shopping list, a heading like: ""vegetables"", ""diary products"", ""breads"" ""snacks"", please? It'd be so helpful!",5
46,app.nifu.simpletodo,Stormy,"good app. however, it is ectremely laggy and slow, and does not run smoothly. I've checked my storage and everything, but it wont go away. I cant deal with it, so sadly I had to delete it. Good app otherwise :/",4
47,app.nifu.simpletodo,B·∫£o Long H√†,"Oh, that was a very good experience! Thanks a lot to the developer! What a great free app! The only need to improve in the note for the task list! Again, thanks a lot to the developer!",4
48,app.nifu.simpletodo,Shoot it Yaar,I love this app. Very simple and clean. No premium version here. Very simple to use. I just hope they add they tasks for tomorrow or any other days. Even though it's very good app.,5
49,app.nifu.simpletodo,Nevena Grijak,"Overall great, but ads are too annoying. I'd be very willing to pay to get rid of them. Same goes for other Simple apps.",4
50,app.nifu.simpletodo,snophia,"I just started using this app and I can tell how great it is, very easy to use and I like how simple and minimalist is but I am recommending to add a widget? So we can see our tasks quickly.",4
51,app.nifu.simpletodo,Dhaval Prajapati,"Dear Developer, I'm Dhaval and I'm very thankful to you for making this simple note + Tasks application.

53,app.nifu.simpletodo,Danielle Danzalan,"the app is actually pretty simple and very pleasing in the eyes; but the problem is it would suddenly delete all my list. i just finished one task and left the app, then i came back and it's all gone.",3
54,app.nifu.simpletodo,Felix Neidhart,"Simple app with basic but sufficient functionality, no ads and great design. Just what I needed! Thanks! Suggestion: add due dates to tasks + order by due date",5
55,app.nifu.simpletodo,Brielle Swanberg,"really great I think, totally helps me set my goals, and remember when and if I've achieved them. it's also great for shopping lists and remembering things. would recommend",5
56,app.nifu.simpletodo,Maggie H,I just downloaded this and so far I do like really like it. However I just wish they would add a widget for it as It would be helpful to always see the list on my home screen. As well as maybe adding time reminders?,3

58,app.nifu.simpletodo,Aaron Edgeworth,"Good app. Clear, easy to read, well laid out. Exactly what you want from a ToDo app to replace a notebook Is there a way to make a one time payment to remove ads",5
59,app.nifu.simpletodo,Franz Jeanielle Leigh Ebio,"I'd prefer if i can just write the tasks along with the list easily, not like i have to press so many buttons to put a note or task something on the specific list or do i even make sense but i'd rate this just so-so so far. y'all can improve, make it ""simple simple""",4
60,app.nifu.simpletodo,Soumili Roy,"I absolutely love this. But I just have one suggestion. Please add a widget option. As someone who forgets and is too lazy to open apps daily, this will be of much help. Otherwise, truly a beautiful app.",4
