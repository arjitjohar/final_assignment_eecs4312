0,com.apalon.to.do.list,Shea Kelly,"A good app for tracking a building good habits. It helps me feel successful and slowly build up my health habits, like drinking water or exercise. Start small and grow from there. It does have some limitations. I can't figure out how to make an account to save my data. Also, the reminders, stats, and unlimited habits should be free, not a subscription. It's the primary reason I gave it 3 stars.",3
1,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"The app is generally well-designed and has a pleasing visual style (much more so than other habit trackers I've tried). If it worked consistently as intended, then it would be just about perfect for my needs, but unfortunately this version is still full of bugs and inconsistencies. As an example, some habits' names and history can be edited and others' can't, with no clear indication as to which is which or why this limitation exists.",3
2,com.apalon.to.do.list,Sush,"The design and functionality of the app is very good to get started on tracking habits at first glance. I didn't feel like trying it out past day 1 though because of the constant reminders to purchase ""premium"". I wanted to try out the features before I get ""premium"" to see if it's a good fit, but the focus seems to be in ensuring the payment is captured before letting someone actually try it out. Doesn't allow me to justify the need to pay such a high ""premium"".",3
3,com.apalon.to.do.list,Thomas Nowroski,"Worthless app. I unfortunately bought the premium version for ""50% off"" for $14.99. It's not even worth a penny. The only thing the paid version let's you do is create unlimited routines and check them off as complete or skip. Doesn't even notify you when you have a set time for notifications. Everything you can do with this app you can do for free via checklist or calendar.",1
4,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"This is an honest request to lower your price. I had this app on my iPhone and I paid a very small one-time fee to have premium version. I absolutely LOVED this app - best habit tracker out there IMO. Clean, intuitive, and Goldilocks (not too little or to much) functionality. I was excited to see it released on Android then promptly very discouraged by the high pay wall erected. It is a fantastic app, however the price is far too high for me to justify. I would prefer to see at a 50% reduction.",3
5,com.apalon.to.do.list,Jessica Lonkey,"It's fine, but I will not continue to use after my subscription is up. The UI is beautiful, no bugs, and it's very clean and easy to use. However it's just very basic. With having to pay I was hoping for at least a widget (so I could be reminded without having to open the app or check my notifications) but there is none. I was going to just continue to use my Google calendar as my task list but I failed to receive a reminder for the upcoming charge so I'm staying with it for now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",3
6,com.apalon.to.do.list,Court Smith,"Just installed this but you can only add 3 tasks before you have to pay, and you will get a ton of notices to try to get you to pay before you even hit that. The interface is nice, clean, and easy to use and is exactly what I'm looking for, but it's $7/mo or $30/yr to use this to-do list. I would definitely pay a one-time fee but the subscription model is way too expensive. I think this could help my ADHD a ton, but it's too much for a to-do list that gets refreshed everyday. I'll uninstall.",2
7,com.apalon.to.do.list,Deborah Grant,"Basic with decent tracking ability once you figure out how, needs instruction page! Also fewer options for customizing than I would like, I just bring up blank tasks to fill in because I know my goals and don't need the ones they want me to set. A feature I'd like is to give us a variety of sounds/volume for task notification, as far as I can see you are stuck with their little 'doink', dumb and too soft... Some improvements could be made but does the job.",3
8,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"Highly not impressed by this app - it's really just a task list with habit-related items included. So under ""Better sleep"" there are subitems like ""go to bed at 10pm"". Picking any gives you a reminder to set at a given time, customize colors and icons, recurrence, etc. You can create your own categories and that's pretty much it. Finding this out requires agreeing to a free trial before the subscription model kicks in, at nearly $7 a month. I canceled via Play same day and I expect no charges.",1
9,com.apalon.to.do.list,Alex Metry,"A well designed app, but I'm not willing to spend $30 a year for a subscription. I could justify a one-time purchase, but not a subscription. It is easy to set goals in the app, and the UI is very clean looking. However, it focuses too much on streaks, so it makes it easier for me to be less strict with myself and check something to continue the streak. Also doesn't do a great job in helping to set specific goals. Just too steep of a price for what it is and needs a couple of improvements.",2
10,com.apalon.to.do.list,Grace L,"I think this app is very useful. So far, I have been able to make as many tasks as I want, whatever symbols, and I can participate in their special tasks and challenges. All without having the premium version. I think this app is really good abt that. They have no adds either and many options for the task! U can skip, complete, or just not mark it! Its really easy and fun to make new tasks too! It really keeps me on track and I love how much u can do with the free version! Great app!",5
11,com.apalon.to.do.list,Ashley Powell,"I have mental disabilities and this app is super helpful. It is helping me really get back to doing things. However, I do wish there was a feature where you could add something to it like a calendar. Because if you use the App as an assistant to your schedule it's crucial you can put appointments and events. I know it's to boost productivity, and it does, but it would be helpful if it could all be in one place.",4
12,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"This has been pretty motivating seeing when I'm on a streak. I did have a negative experience when adding a goal. I thought a goal meant that there was an extra notification when I've managed to perform a habit successfully for a predefined streak of days, but it's actually a goal for times within a day. I set a goal of doing 100 pushups/day x 5 days, then realized it was a goal of doing 100x5/day, which I can't. I then tried to turn it off but it cannot turn off once set, so I think it's a bug.",4
13,com.apalon.to.do.list,James Davis,"I like this app alright, and so far it's the closest thing I've found to what I need, but what it's missing is -customizable time chunks: I have stuff I need to do right when I wake up, and then a whole different set of things I need to do during the rest of my morning, and same with ""evening"" vs ""bedtime"". Especially when putting school into the mix. -subroutines! Yeah, I need to moisturize, but that's part of a bigger morning hygiene routine! Lists within lists if you want (advanced mode?)",3
14,com.apalon.to.do.list,Shreya Halbe,"Too many Premium features..... What's an app without some non premium features. The subscription cannot be justified. I can't have more than 4 tasks...but the whole point of the app is to track tasks. The subscription is absurdly expensive for a productitvity app and the moment I saw so much potential, so much I could have done, I deleted it. I hope you improve on that...I will love to download it again....if I can use it at least to half its purpose without having to buy Premium.",2
15,com.apalon.to.do.list,William Hovenden,"The app itself does just what it's meant to, without costing so much it breaks the bank. I wish that it had a widget so I could track my progress and see what i need to do without opening the app every time. I find myself forgetting I even have the app over time or not using it sometimes due to not seeing or remembering it. If they had a widget this would be significantly better.",3
16,com.apalon.to.do.list,Tanbia Mills,"No where to sign in to access to cancel subscription. Making it very hard so that people won't. I don't like that slickness. 2 stars for the concept and simple layout if I wanted to keep it. I just think Fabulous app, offers way more and is more helpful too, so I'm keeping that instead. I thought I wouldn't mind to check it out but not worth it to keep. ****update I had to literally uninstall the app, then search google sign in Productive tracker Apalon for the home page to sign in and cancel!!",2
17,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"They got greedy. I used to own an iPhone and Productive offered two versions - free and paid. The free version offered 6 habits and a gazillion of icons, icon colors, and other customization tools. The paid version was a flat rate but it was worth it. Now, Android version sucks! The free version includes only 4 habits, some icons, and 6 colors! Instead of paying a flat rate to upgrade, they want you to subscribe and pay $7 monthly. I'd pay a flat rate, but to subscribe? Never! P. S. No widgets!",1
18,com.apalon.to.do.list,Jessica Edwards,"I wanted to like this but the notifications never worked, even though I double and triple checked the notification settings in the app directly and in my settings as well, giving the app priority on notifications. Only after I opened the app each day of the trial period, would notifications start popping off. The layout is nice, but my main need was for this app was prompt notifications to keep me on track and it failed to do so.",2
19,com.apalon.to.do.list,Madeline Folz,"Saying ""you have have four habits in the free version"" is very misleading because it implied that you can always have 4. When in fact you can only have 4 for all time... I had to delete my fourth habit after only a few day because the tally was not cumulative, so I thought I might have set it up wrong and was going to re-enter. Well I can't now. If I try to save the habit it brings me to a pay wall, and closing it takes me back to the edit screen where I once again can not save.",2
20,com.apalon.to.do.list,Jessica Axelson,I was really hoping for a better experience with this app. I even purchased the add free option. I wish I had not. I will be deleting the app all together. The graphics are beautiful. This app is not user-friendly to me by any means. I found the option to rate the app and have not been able to straight line to contact so I am leaving a review prior to reaching out to customer service because I have no interest in staying with this app at all. The only reason to reach out would be for a refund.,2
21,com.apalon.to.do.list,Lexie ‚ÄúStrawB3rryJ3lly‚Äù,"I have been using this app for years, on iPhone, for example I have premium when it was a lifetime access for a one time fee. I was extremely happy to find it on play store when I switched to Android. However I can't transfer any of my years of data, ok I can deal with that. But I can't restore my premium purchase either. I am very sad to not have this app for the first time in years. It was a great run while it lasted.",2
22,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"I really like the interface, but I just can't with the harassment to subscribe. I get it, I have limited features, but to not be able to do anything without being hounded by a subscribe option is ridiculous. Great looking app and I'm sure it would meet my needs, but I'm sure there's another one out there that can meet my needs without constantly beating me over the head with an impending subscription service. Thank you.",2
23,com.apalon.to.do.list,Emily Friel,"Not worth the money. Signed up for the 7 day free trial, forgot to unsubscribe, ended up paying for a full year üòë Ended up removing the app because it was overriding the Do Not Disturb setting on my phone and waking me up with notifications at 6am. I tried everything to get it to stop but couldn't find a solution so in the bin it went.",1
24,com.apalon.to.do.list,Evan Buyok,"I kind of wish that it wasn't a monthly subscription, but at the same time I know that nothing in life is free, and I would much rather pay the fee than see ads every 10 seconds like I do on other free apps. I am a procrastinator, so I find this app incredibly useful both at work, and at home. If you have issues with procrastination, I would definitely give this app a try. It even has a free trial, so you get to see if you like it before it makes you pay a dime which is awesome.",5
25,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"Has a very nice UI. I'd be very happy to pay a one time purchase, but a subscription, especially one that costs as much as this one, doesn't make any sense for this app. It's a habit tracker, there's no service being provided here, there's no reason I would pay every month to use an app like this one. It's extremely important that developers be able to monetize the things they make, and at the same time, picking a monetization method that's a bad fit for what you're selling can kill interest",2
26,com.apalon.to.do.list,Kai Jun,"Great looking app. I created an account and I tried it on my device. But when I tried to log in in my other phone, my previously created habits wasn't sync. I couldn't find a backup and restore button, neither I found it mention in the ad for subscription (all the ad show was a countdown and X% off, no detail what premium offers). So I am assuming that the app wasn't sync across device because I didn't pay for the subscription... Hard pass, no, disappoints me before I even decide",2
27,com.apalon.to.do.list,Savannah,"I really like this ap. However, unless sive done something wrong, it doesn't give you reminders (even when you set them up) about your challenges or tasks and you have to open the app to see them - this isn't very good if you're not great at keeping a habit or are forgetful. Additionally, if you don't open the app for a day it assumes you missed the challenge for that day, as opposed to asking if you did the challenge or not.",4
28,com.apalon.to.do.list,Amanda,"Love the design of this app, it's very easy to navigate and looks beautiful with the colour schemes and graphics. Only complaint is that it's misleading to say the app is free, you don't have to pay to install it, but you do have to pay a subscription to get good use of it. The free trial version only allows a few habits and constantly pop ups to subscribe. Totally understandable from the developers, but I wouldn't advertise it as free. Maybe say free version is limited or something.",4
29,com.apalon.to.do.list,Manuel Kirchen,"This app seems well designed with a smooth and beautiful design. But there is no free version and you can't test the app without engaging to pay after a 7 days trial (not free to me if you have to input a credit card which will be debited if you don't resign, especially if the app will automatically bill you a yearly fee!). The cost is really high too (7‚Ç¨/month!!!!), which is for me way too much for such an app. A one time fee of 7‚Ç¨ would still be a very high price compared to other apps...",1
30,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"The app is pretty. I'm happy to find a habit tracker with a beautiful interface for a change. However, as many of the reviewers already pointed out. 1) The free version is way too limited. 6 or 7 habits sound a lot more raisonnable in my opinion, while still incentivizing people to purchase the full version. 2) The premium version requires a monthly subscription. This just won't work for the app right now. A one time purchase seems much more raisonable.",3
31,com.apalon.to.do.list,Nicholas Koukoutsis,"I love the app, and I use this to keep track of my daily routine. But I have two major gripes with it. The first gripe is that from the layout and spacing of everything, it's not very compact. I feel like this is more of a fun view than a ""managing"" view. Making things slightly more compact can go a long way to helping actually manage the day, and be more productive. My last gripe is not being able to sync premium subscription with my iPad.",3
32,com.apalon.to.do.list,Shaun Myandee,"Before you can even try out the app you are forced into a ""free trial"" that renews into an insanely expensive annual plan. Not worth it, there are plenty of other alternatives that let you try them out before committing to any sort of premium version. Edit: there is indeed a tiny exit button at the top of the trial screen. If you press it you can continue to the app with a subscription notice popping up frequently. Still obnoxious, but less so.",2
33,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"I used to use this app years ago on iOS, it was absolutely my favourite habit tracker app and nothing else could compare. However, if I remember correctly, it was about 8$ for the full version and a one-time payment. Absolutely worth the 8$ at the time. I am utterly disappointed to find that it is now 11$ PER MONTH! I was so excited to finally see this app on Android and my hopes have been completely crushed after seeing that. I'd be happy to pay even $20 as a one-time payment but not 11$/month",1
34,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"It looks decent, good interface and idea but once you find your way around the immediate ads and attempts to sell you a subscription, you are very limited. You can only have around 4 habits before it tells you that you've reached your limit (and to pay to get more). Not worth it at all. Suggestions: allow 10 free habits, lower the subscription price (a lot).",2
35,com.apalon.to.do.list,Aaryan Moin,"This app is really nice looking. The UI is super smooth and beautiful. it's also very functional with great features. there are some HUGE downsides, however. there's no account system or multi-device sync. it's also veeery expensive, at $9/month. I can get an Office 365 subscription for a lot cheaper that's just too much for this app. this app clearly had a lot of time and care put into it, so if you have the money you'll really enjoy it, but for most people this amount of money isn't worth it.",2
36,com.apalon.to.do.list,Jordy,"It's a nice app, great UI, visuals and animations. However, this is all useless if you annoy users with subscription popups all the time. Either offer it as a paid app or remove those popups and just limit some functionalities. Another problem is the monthly fee, which is high, especially because additional benefits are limited and there are tons of free alternatives. It could be a 5 star app if these things are improved.",2
37,com.apalon.to.do.list,Esteban Palacios,"It's a great app, but the free version just isn't worth it. What I like, (and usually pay for) is when the premium subscription has important features but they are not necessary to have a basic experience. I would recommend to change your tactics. In this case limiting the amount of habits really hurt, plus the intensity of premium ""incentive"" also felt off. It's better to not offer the premium subscription so much, offer unlimited habits, and rely on ads (non interfering ones, not ad walls).",3
38,com.apalon.to.do.list,Melanie Gesy,"I really enjoyed this app, but there is an issue with the notifications. I don't want any of them to make noise, yet the very first one of the day seems to override my DND settings & makes noise. I still want the notification on my screen just not the noise and can't seem to turn that off without disabling all the notifications in the system settings. This app is a great alternative for the habit app that starts with an F (don't want to name it).",3
39,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"The app is fine. Artwork alone makes it enjoyable to track your habbits. Other than that, it has more or less the same functions as most habbit tracker apps out there. Now, the subcription is ridiculously high. Look, I'm okay to pay, but for a simple app like this, it rather a one off. And again, comparing to the market, it's just too expensive with little unique values.",2
40,com.apalon.to.do.list,Joel Cheung,"Things I like, beautiful UI design in the app, I like the simplicity and how things are structured. It was a pleasure to use, I can see a lot of effort were put into UX design of the app. Things I did not like. The ""trial or pay for a monthly sub"" screen, and trying it would put you to a yearly subscription. (half of the reviews are about this issue, so I don't need to explain that.) You have a person doing review damage control, saying ""you don't get charged after the trial"" or whatever. Sure. But my problem is, how is this issue still here? You have been hearing the complain as long as the app is in play store. Why is the ""trail or pay"" screen get an update to explain how the payment works better, so users don't feel tricked into a subscription. Paid only apps are great if that goes back to the app getting better over time. I frankly don't see that.... :( (also, would more likely to do a paid trial for a month or two, without having to ""lock in"" for a year)",2
41,com.apalon.to.do.list,Luke Shaw,"Great app, good execution, bad problems I like the app a lot. Used it a lot up until I got a new phone. The app doesn't save on the cloud nor does it have a way to save the stats or share them with a new phone. I lost my streak of doing 50 push ups and 50 squats every day and I had been doing it for a half year...I was suddenly very defeated in my habit knowing all that app progress had gone.",2
42,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"One thing I'd like to see is the evolution of streaks. As in, instead of just seeing your current and your best streak, you see some sort of graph showing the history of streak lengths to really visualize how much one has improved. For what it does, 6 bucks a month is just too much. I'd much rather have ads than pay that. As a one-off thing; okay, sure. Monthly? Hell nah.",3
43,com.apalon.to.do.list,Muhammad Sirajo,Great design; great experience. Subscription is a bit on the high side though and a sync feature will really be nice. Update: Been more than a year since my last review and still no sync feature. I tried to create an account on the app's website but it seems web accounts are treated differently from app accounts. I can't keep subscribing if you can't offer sync.,3
44,com.apalon.to.do.list,Renee Ragragio,"The app is simple and visually pleasing. I really love the interface of this app and this would've been the best app for me except for the fact that the premium subscription is quite expensive yet not really worth it. I would like to suggest adding a widget feature and more cosmetic features (e.g. more color selections), if so, then the premium subscription will be more worth the price and I would definitely avail it.",4
45,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"First thing you get slapped in the face with $8 per month?! For a reminder app that tracks and display like a diagram in XL? Everybody wants to charge monthly without providing much. Take a look at 9email. That's an app that I actually do work on, for hours a day. At times I prefer that over Outlook on desktop. I would be happy to pay upwards $50/month. But it's only $15 ONE TIME FEE. Smart concept, because there is no free version. Use it? Pay. We all pay, and price gets low.",1
46,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"Before being able to even use the app, you are given the choice to make an account, or try the app for free, if you give your payment card. After 7 days, it will start a yearly(!) subscription. I thought okay. When I opened the app again, a button on the top was saying ""Try for Free"". No mention that I already have a subscription. When I click on Try for Free, it asks if I want to try it and then have a monthly subscription. Very sly and sneaky, instantly lost trust. Don't trust them.",1
47,com.apalon.to.do.list,Alisha,"I love this app it is so beautiful yet easy to use. It is very good for people like me who need a little bit of external help to assist me in creating good habits. As a woman, all the cleaning tasks I have to remember are so overwhelming... more overwhelming than the cleaning itself. But this app is like an external hard drive freeing up space in my mind to make it have an extremely powerful performance. Would like the option of more colours and icons as I love my colours but otherwise 10/10!",5
48,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"Dark color scheme only, somewhat small number of habits (the way they are repeated in every section is annoying), no ""to-do"" list feature at all unlike advertised. Very costly subscription. Well, you asked for suggestions.

49,com.apalon.to.do.list,Ruby Ann,"I love the simplicity of this app. I love the reminders and how I have control over how I want my habits to be done. I love the colors, the fonts, the interface, the sounds. I just wish that it has a one-time payment in contrast to monthly payments. I also hope they will lower the price or have more promotions. I'm still pondering on whether I should purchase or not. The notification to purchase is a bit intrusive and fussy.",4
50,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"I should not have to insert my payment data just for the free trial. They do this so that u start paying as soon as it end probably without giving you any notice Edit: the developers have control over the app not some store.

It's smooth, and it looks nice to me. There are so many reminders/habits that you can easily hand pick from the options given. Like sleeping, online studying, and so much more!

52,com.apalon.to.do.list,Lara Lannon,It's not an exaggeration to say this app is life changing. Do you find it hard to remember small things like checking on your house plants everyday? Brushing your teeth? Do you make to-do lists that never get finished? I sure did. Until I downloaded this app and decided to stick to it everyday. It really is amazing and helps with healthy routines. Thank you sincerely to the developers. If there was one thing to change it would be to hide or minimize the completed daily tasks. Please add this.,5
53,com.apalon.to.do.list,David Klompas,"The app itself is excellent. There's no fault whatsoever, which is why there are two stars. My gripe comes with the price: ZAR119 per month! This is an absurd price to pay for a habit tracker. It's almost as much as Netflix for a month! The app is therefore an utter failure, in my view. I'd be willing to pay R500 for lifetime usage. But not the price of Netflix for one stupid month!",2
54,com.apalon.to.do.list,A Google user,"I love the interface and that there's no distracting added extras.
