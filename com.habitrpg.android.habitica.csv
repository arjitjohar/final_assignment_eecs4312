0,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Ivan Martinez,"I'm enjoying the app so far. I couldn't figure out how to make a group for my family and close friends. It seems like the Party feature isn't customizable and the Guild feature requires currency which I'm not that far into yet. Also, I find it annoying that I can't organize my tasks by dragging it around the way I see fit. The filter is the only option which I have to redo that everytime which gets a little annoying. Overall, I'm enjoying this app as it did help with my productivity.",4
1,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Aaron Kaufman,"I really like the app overall - it's well made and i enjoy the UI. One thing though - the ""monthly, day of week"" Daily function spans multiple surrounding days rather than only Saturday, for example. So that might be a hard hit for users hoping to use that. I would also love being able to preemptively pause a daily for when I'm on vacation, out of the normal rhythm, etc! EDIT: for pausing specific dailies, a great feature would be for specific ones, in addition to the all-at-once option",5
2,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,M Smith,"I really really dispise apps that require you to be connected in order to use them. There's no reason for it. I'm a professional pilot which means if I can't check off habits while I'm at work, and I cross into midnight in whatever time zone, I lose points making the whole game pretty lame. There is no need to have to be connected in order to check off habits.",1
3,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Mary Blackberry,"It's useful and it's fun, I haven't seen an add in the weeks I have been using it so far. It was time consuming to set up all my tasks but once set up it's great. The only issue I have is with the glitches, when I first go to check things off it moves the list around and checks off the wrong tasks but it's easy to fix, just annoying that it happens every single day.",4
4,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Cody Harold,"Just downloaded yesterday, so far so good. I just wish I could customize the date options a bit more. For example, I would like to do a task 2-3 times a week, and the only way I can currently put it into the habit tracker is by selecting the specific days to do the task on, which isn't realistic for me. I'm also using this for cleaning tasks, one I'd like to do biweekly, which also isn't an option currently. Overall really cute app that's very motivating for self care and chores.",4
5,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Stryder Hudlow,"I've had this app for almost 3 years and I can sincerely say that it's borderline perfection. You can customize it to your hearts content, the motivation potential is massive, a great example of this is my tasks to deal with projects, to-dos, learning, exercise, and so much more every single day. It's basically the only reason I'm even close to a high schooler/pseudo college student depending on the subject. Try it out for a few months, you'll get sucked into productivity like never before!",5
6,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Whoza,"A strong three and a half. It definitely helps me with managing and doing tasks, to an extent. It REALLY helps me most on my daily tasks (like taking meds, brushing my teeth). However, after using it awhile, it does seem to plateau. I do recommend as it's quite helpful, but ultimately feels a little lacking. I would love to see the ability to trade items with your party, and to be able to use your gold to buy food for your pets!",3
7,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Rachel Blandon,"It has some strong features (like the party system) but overall the gamification aspect suffers due to lack of organization and customizability, especially on mobile. For example, the equipment is shown as a mere list of items and you have to scroll through every row to find what you want. There's also the problem with the Tavern and the moderation system. I find it very annoying that moderators will come down on users for the slightest offense, and then leave a public notice shaming them.",3
8,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Rachel Kaelin,"One of the first and remains one of the best. Turns your to-do list into an RPG. You earn items, pets, and customization options. It's fun to join friends in parties and attack bosses together, then dress yourself like a fish. Uses more negative reinforcement, which i don't care for, but there are ways to mitigate the effect because everything is so customizable. Endgame is frustrating because upward growth becomes stymied after a while, but character can be reset, and updates are constant.",5
9,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Nasim Faridnia,"I've had the app for more than two years. The quest feature is great for staying motivated. The to do list widget and support of markdown are also big advantages. I wish there was a better feature for getting an overview of how we've done in a week, like with charts and graphs. Another suggestion is adding a Pomodoro timer for each task.",4
10,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Reilly Henson,"I wanted to find a to-do list app that would give you a little ""celebration"" when you checked something off, for those times when it's hard to stay motivated. Habitica is that, plus so much more! It's fun to use, and can be as simple or as in-depth as you choose. It's a great way to stay organized, and to keep yourself from procrastinating too much. You can really tell that the developers enjoyed making the app, which adds to the charm.",5
11,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,vishnu narang,The user experience is terrible. I just couldn't figure out how to get a daily habit going. Never got a reminder after I created a task a month or more ago. I may have not set it up correctly but that's the user experience problem. It's not intuitive at all. I'm willing to try it again if the design and ux changes and it becomes more intuitive,2
12,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Enzo P,This app has given me the boost to my drive allowing me to complete a lot more. There's a few minor quality of life changes that could make it better like: adding different color tabs for each task based on it's difficulty (i.e. trivial=yellow; easy=orange; etc.). Hope to see this app grow and reach more people the way it's reached me and my friends.,5
13,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Rose,"Habitica is a super cool concept developed by people who know what they're doing in terms of code and game design, but fall short on UX design specifically for the app. There are so many features, it's hard to organize them well in the app. Highly recommend the desktop version, still recommend this app but just not as much.",4
14,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Fletcher B,"This is amazing. Its so cool, a rpg but with doing habits is the way to level up and attack bosses is amazing! If I could add one thing to this it would be customisable achevments One example is [grass slayer] where you mark it on a habit that's to mow the lawn and you can set the goal amount at 100 meaning you need to check off that habit 100 times This achevent system will rather need a self checking to set the amount of exp and gold, or just none and is just for showing off.",5
15,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Coati Maxheimer,"This app is amazing! It's been so helpful to my ADHD so far. My only gripes are that, occasionally, there are glitches that make it so if you drag to reorder something it goes farther than it's supposed to, and it will display the habits as a different habit than it is. These are easy to fix by restarting the app, though. I also really want a way to copy a to do, habit, or daily so that I don't have to rewrite a long check list on a to-do that only appears again on an irregular basis.",4
16,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Jason Carwile,"Has been great, love the app. One recommendation: I would like to see the dailies have a scheduling option that allows a range of dates for a monthly task, such as a report that needs done sometime during the first week of the month but not having that daily give damage for not completing it until you fail to complete by the end and once it's checked for the week it doesn't show up again until the next month.",4
17,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,H Grootonk,"The app is cute and a fun idea but i have had no success from gameifying my life. If it doesn't help build habits, what's the point? I would focus on better methods than trying to trick your dopamine-starved brain into doing boring or unpleasant tasks easily. It doesn't seem to work for very long once the novelty wears off. 🤷",2
18,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,The concept is great and it's a fun way to keep track of your habits. My only gripes are: -I wish there was a better way to see habit streaks. The number is cool but if we could see it on a calendar like view I think that would be helpful. You could miss a day and if streaks aren't set to reset the number remains unchanged. -Better explanation of the colors on streaks. I still don't know what they mean (going to Google it). -You can't use rogue skills because you get a blue screen.,3
19,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Very creative and useful app. It has a LOT of potential, but it needs a lot of work still. You should be able to scale tasks more dynamically, as huge tasks should give huge rewards but tiny tasks should give tiny rewards. One idea would be to allow users to select the scale of the task, from choices such as ""long-term,"" ""short-term"" and ""daily"" each with very different rewards.",5
20,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Asja Misner,"The idea behind the app is incredibly unique and exciting, and the retro graphics tap into the old-school cool factor. However, the ""game"" part is way too complicated because there are hundreds of parts and animals and food and potions and clothing and quests, and none of it is actually explained nor is there a clear path to follow. Because of that, it was off-putting so I tried for a week and decided that the original idea and purpose of the app is what I need, but not this one. 💙",3
21,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"I really like the concept of this app, the style, the features, and it has done its part in motivating my studies and organizing my life. However, the app needs some serious redesigning. The layout is difficult to navigate and the chat function is almost useless. The way challenges are organized could also use improvement. All in all, I like using it (make an account a month ago), but the functionality needs to be improved",4
22,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Chee- “Nickname” Rex,"This app is awesome for encouraging habits since it is satisfying to progress like a game. I love the pets we can get. If I could find a thing to improve, it would be adding an option for a separate to do list for ""today"" and ""later."" That way every morning, we can choose a few to-dos for today from our long list. Also, sometimes the app says I have no habits, dailies, to-dos, etc. when I open it, so I have to reopen the app to get them to show up.",5
23,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Great concept, but there are numerous issues that I found right off the bat. The main one for me was the fact that, once you pick a subject for your journey you can never go back and change that. I mean, there are multiple journey subjects to choose from and maybe I want to focus on one aspect of my life at a time. The app treats life like a game, after all and most games allow you to start over with different settings. Starting over in THIS game requires you to uninstall the app, reinstall the app and then create a brand new account. Kind of silly and frustrating to boot. Check out the Level Life Up app instead. It has a much better platform.",3
24,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Motivation is by far the hardest aspect to tackle when it come to these types of apps; especially when they're apps that you can shut down at a moment's notice.  This app however, brings out the best in you by rewarding you in points that you can use to buy inventory for your ""quests."" At first, I felt skeptical because I believed that I would waste all my time playing the rpg version of this game more than my tasks, but all was well when I figured out that the ""quests"" are actually completed behind the scenes and are only dictated by your ability to stay on track.  You control your character, without actually wasting time controlling it...brilliant!",5
25,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,JJ Barajas,"It's a great app for shaking out the mind fog, really cute as well. It's a little overwhelming at first, but makes sense after spending time with it. It would be cool if the app had different skins, 8 bit is nice but 16bit would look even better. An opportunity for aesthetic user generated content perhaps? I'm only leaving off a star because sometimes it glitches and won't show any of your tasks.. you have to close and reopen, and in some cases clear the cache. Very annoying.",4
26,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Ive had this app before and it didnt really help me then, but I'm using it again with much better results already after just a few days. I normally don't write reviews, but when I started having issues from basically accidentally setting up two accounts, i ended up sending a bug report and got it all situated by the end of the day and without losing any of my progress. Super happy with the help i received on my issue and love the way the app is set up not only for convenience, but also for fun!",5
27,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Catherine Tran,"Good concept but seems a bit buggy so far. The positive/negative setup is not the most intuitive thing to figure out, as well as some other features. While trying to initially set up my tasks, I tried to adjust the streaks, and it would not save my adjustment. So idk. The app could use some more QA I think, & maybe some work on UX? Hoping it all gets better over time. The character creation is cute and I like the reward aspect of it.",3
28,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Kimberly S.,"I like it, I really do. But it keeps resetting so that I can't see my progress. A habit will go from +3/-1 to 0/0. It's a bit annoying. I got this so I could show myself that I'm succeeding more often than failing, but it's annoying to have it constantly reset. I found myself a little fix, where I screenshot it every time, but that messes with my leveling up. I want to gain points by completing things and gaining habits. I don't want to double that by trying to fix it all the time.",3
29,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"This app is a great idea and I love all the features. However, no matter what I set the day start time to for daily tasks to reset, they keep resetting at some seemingly random point in the middle of the day despite me having it at 2AM, which is causing all of my evening tasks and some of my midday tasks to fail as I haven't done them yet. I'm not sure if the app thinks I'm in a different time zone or what but it's very irritating. If they fix that it's 5 stars for sure.",3
30,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Kyle “FreakGamer” Polo,"I want to like it. This app on the surface is pretty nice, the functionality is solid and it's made well... but then you hit the pay wall. Most of the game is locked behind Gems to buy items and quests in games; I don't even have a problem with the items behind the pay wall, but the quests, and other things, that's a step too far. Theoretically you can earn gems, but you've got to do challenges, and that would be fine, if they didn't randomly select only five players to win. Needs more balance.",3
31,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Excellent app. I tried several schedule & checklist/ notes apps, and they failed to help me. My schedule isn't consistent enough to follow a set schedule, and the checklists just became mundane and overwhelming to the point of neglect. With this app I can set a few base habits I'm trying to form, a few things I need to accomplish daily, and set near future goals for task to complete, projects to begin, etc. The RPG aspect is motivating, along with quests, collectibles, a great community.",5
32,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Have been looking for a way to incorporate the elements of gaming into making progress ""In Real Life"". Even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic! Really like it and it has made a big difference! The only reason I took it down a star is because it depletes my phone battery really fast if I am in the app for very long, such as when I am shopping or browsing challenges, so I do these things mostly on my PC. Overall, great job! Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys gaming but is struggling with motivation in the real world.",4
33,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Angela,"App is cool on the surface but has some things that could be improved on. For example, some things just aren't finished or stop working. In a couple customization menus there isn't an option to take off accessories while that option is available in others. Menus suddenly stop working and you have to close and reload the app to fix it. There is no in depth tutorial and a lot of stuff is up to you to figure out which can be confusing because the User Interface isn't always clear.",3
34,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Pretty great app, motivates me to do stuff I normally wouldn't want to because of the prospect of leveling up. One small gripe I have is that if something with a reminder is marked complete before the reminder goes off, it still reminds you even though you've already done it. Also, sounds when you mark something, etc come out the Ringtone channel, not the Media channel.",4
35,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Stetson_Newsie,"I've only just started up, but this app has progressed so much since I last saw it! UI is really tidy and easy to use. It doesn't feel like everything is locked behind a paywall (though I plan to support). Tasks/rewards/etc. are easy to customize, so the game can be tailored to exactly what you need. I have ADHD, so an app that makes every task a fun/novel experience is fantastic. I'm hoping this becomes a well worn tool in my belt. Thanks to the devs for creating such a useful resource ❤",5
36,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Maria Wang,"I really love the app, it's helped so much with my procrastination, especially on big projects. It's helping me to be more mindful about some bad habits and gradually making them weaker as well! However, I think that it's kinda annoying that some of my challenge related tasks turn bright red for not doing them... They're the feedback type that's due at the end of the month, so yes, I can't do them before hand.",5
37,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Sam Jones,"What an adorable and inspirational app! I have actually done things I was considering putting off because I didn't want to lose too much life and thus important items I really need/like. I've even gotten my partner to download it! It also doesn't penalize you too harshly for ""falling off the wagon,"" so to speak, and not using it for some time. As in, days to YEARS. It's the perfect combination of motivational and understanding, which is the perfect recipe for success, at least for myself. 🤓",5
38,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"I'm new to the app but I already love it. I was looking for an app that would help keep me on task and help me to work towards important goals. This app has so many amazing features! I've tried a few other video game-esque routine apps, so I'm certain that this one is the best. There are habits like eating healthy or going out for a walk, daily goals like taking a shower or finishing your homework, and big-picture to do lists. The best thing about these features is that they can be customized.",5
39,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Jay Hanuman,"The best habit tracker I've ever used- and I've tried almost all the gamifiied versions. This is an all in one, and is FREE to use. There are no ads, no paywall to deal with, and there's a ton of incredible widgets and browser extensions to use as well. There's a reason why this rpg still leads the pack. The only time you would pay is if you'd want to support the team and unlock some extra (non-critical) features. And even the subscription ($5/month) is dirt cheap.",5
40,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"I really want to use this app, but on my Galaxy S10, the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in, are blank. The character visuals on the character customization are invisible, and on the settings menu, I scroll down and the options start to overlap each other (hard to describe). I will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app, but currently it's unusable for me.",1
41,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"A really great idea with a lot of great features! I love it a lot. However, it's a bit unresponsive at times. Actions that previously worked will occasionally not go through for mystery reasons . And the widgets, while displaying correctly, have bad interactivity. Thats said, the art is cute, the features are helpful and extensive, and the positive impact it has on my habits is amazing",4
42,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Graham Ryder,"Absolutely love the app. Helps my friends and I organize our routines better, change/improve our habits, and have fun while doing it. My only problem with the game is that you can't set differing difficulties for succeeding/failing a challenge. Sometimes I'd like an easy challenge/daily to not reward me greatly, but punish me more severely should I fail, or vice versa.",4
43,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Jeremy O,"The game aspect is fun, and can provide a little added motivation, but beyond that it's one of the best free to-do apps I've found. The organization is easy, and the breakdown of habits, daily (or other schedule) tasks on repeat, and a one time to-do list give much more depth than apps that claim to be more ""professional."" If you like the game-ify idea this app is great. If you want a solid, free task manager, ignore the cute icons and go with this one as well.",5
44,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Over the years the platform has become stagnant. I was a huge proponent of Habitica, using it for a few years and even paying for a subscription to support development; but development beyond bug fixes never happened. It's a good tool with a potent gamification component, but they've failed to continue to make it engaging and interesting—and certainly not worth paying to support.",3
45,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"I've been using Habitica for years. It isn't perfect, but it is by far the best productivity app out there for gamers. The avatars are cute and the quests are entertaining and motivating, and these also don't distract from what's really important here: self-improvement. The only thing that could be better is the filter system, particularly when it comes to the to-do list. Using the tags can be tedious and confusing if you happen to have a lot of tasks with subtasks. Priority lists would be cool.",5
46,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"So far it's pretty good. I've been using it about a week. Sometimes it doesn't refresh, but the other users on the app seem positive and friendly. There is a lot that I am learning through users that isn't actually explained in the app. Like if you don't do all your daily tasks, the whole party takes damage. So yeah, no pressure! It would be nice for a better help options or a more detailed in-app-fist-time training/learning session. Every 'first' should option for more info!",4
47,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"This app is either really good or really bad/broken --- there are no in betweens. I love the concept, and its super cute, but it bugs out quite a bit and besides which, is super easy to misclick on. As a result, I've lost or accidentally lost items, as well as accidentally spending nearly all of my coins completely on accident because there's no verification for buying and no refunding??? And that's besides the part where it constantly unequips all of my gear... This game needs help...",2
48,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Stess Alvarado,Amazing app! It has really helped me to focus on what needs to get done in my life. A couple of suggestions on how this could be even better: 1st add a calendar function so we can look back and see when we completed a task (especially if it is repetitive task like doing laundry or washing dishes etc. to track our progress) and 2nd it would be great if it could sync with other calendars like google calendar or iCal. Please!!! I would love an update like this!!!,4
49,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Enjoying the app so far, but the widgets are quite limiting. You cannot use check lists in the widgets, and sometimes they update rather weirdly. I have also had UI bugs throughout, but they haven't affected me too much. Overall good, but just needs some tweaking to make it more solid. That's not to say the service is bad. Just the mobile app.",3
50,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Ouoertheo Ouo,"I've used this app for a long long time. Even without the game mechanics, as a task list and habit builder, it is unparalleled. Add in tight communities and an infinite number of challenges to pick from, many many different play style and motivation schemes and you have an impressive tool for life. I like to use it to curb impulse spending. If I want to buy something, I put it on my rewards, and then complete my tasks and dailys until I can afford my desires through productivity.",5
51,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"I'm a breath away from uninstalling this app again. Half the time it doesn't even do what it's supposed to do, some things it doesn't even let you do inside the app, you have to go to the actual browser version to do it. On that subject, the mobile browser is beyond awkward, no chance of navigating it properly! If I'm supposed to log into an actual PC just to check off that I did a workout or washed dishes, forget it. Right now the only reward I get is having my good mood ruined; certainly not worth it.",2
52,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Megan Davis,"I love the new dark mode, I use dark mode for everything so this is much appreciated. The design has been streamlined and it's easy to use. I do check off all my tasks in one go, so the rewards popup blocking the last item on the list is a little annoying but workable. Just gotta wait a second for it to go away.",4
53,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Kathy Luo,"Love the app so far. Great for motivation, but non-punishing, cute graphics, and lots of stuff to explore. Splitting up tasks by priority/type is awesome. It really has made everyday life feel more guided and fun! Would highly recommend for people who enjoy collecting, gaming, or seeing your progress add up. *One note is that sometimes, lists of tasks disappear/show tasks already completed. Closing and reopening fixes it, but would appreciate it if this bug was addressed.",5
54,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"I'm easily motivated by things like points and streaks, so this app works really well for me to increase my productivity and decrease my anxiety. I use rewards for breaks, and find that I get unpleasant but short tasks done much more often, because I can earn breaks quickly by just getting them over with. I also get my long, complicated, multi-part projects done early. I gave it four stars because there are a couple of features I'd like to see, but it works great as is.",4
55,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"The instant gratification of getting xp is super motivating, but more importantly, this is the only productivity app I've found that doesn't seem to be geared to people who work creatively full time or have a white collar job. It's super alienating to read about how an app will help me meet deadlines or check my email. Habitica isn't like that; it's for everyone.",5
56,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Jasmine McFall,"The BEST app for motivation and tracking! Even putting the game aspect aside, I have never seen a more user-friendly app for habit/task tracking. I love how there are different categories for habits, tasks, and daily to-dos. It's customizable. Getting coins is motivation! Ive recommended it to everyone! Only thing I wish it had: a way to see your stats based on your missed to dos or frequency of habits. For instance: most health lost due to *blank* etc.",5
57,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"I immediately encountered a problem when I began, by misclicking on one of my Habits. There's no way to correct for that. Manually change the values, yes, but the xp and hp don't change to reflect that automatically. Secondly, the settings page is broken on my S9, and the issue is difficult to describe. The display freezes so if you scroll, an instance of the text moves while the another is stuck below. Honestly the tutorial really needs work. I could go on but space constraints.",2
58,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"pros: many. if you really struggle with self care or just need a place to put your to do list and get some virtual rewards, this is all for you. cute design, some features that allow some interaction with others but you curate your own experience. cons: some tiny bugs that occasionally pop up while trying to input new tasks, but any piece of tech will have bugs. these are annoying -- not experience-breaking",5
59,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Great app that has helped me with lifestyle improvements. Extremely customizable - rather than forcing you into any particular format or reward structure, Habitica is mostly what you make of it. To me, this is its best quality. I love game design exercises, so the flexibility and open approach allow me to define my own terms and rewards for ""gamifying"" a daily/weekly routine. The routine itself becomes a fun creative problem to solve. It may not work for everyone, but it's exactly what I needed!",5
60,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"It's fun, a great concept, but the app itself needs work. It locks up constantly and has to be manually shut down and then re-started, and the reminders basically don't work at all. Honestly I think it would be best to remove the reminder feature for now until it can be fixed, because not having a way to set one at all is better than using the feature and thinking you'll get a needed reminder when you won't because it doesn't actually work.",3
61,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Amanda K.,"I love using this app. It seems to be the only option that can assign points for completing each habit, daily task and to-do and then set up your own rewards to use those earned points. I needed more motivation to get stuff stuff, and this gamifies things for me. However, I would really like a way to reuse completed to-dos. I want to be able to click on the completed task and then save it to have it as a new, open task. I do some things regularly but not as dailies or on set days.",4
62,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"its a good app, its free, it allows you to do as many habits as you want, it keeps track of your streek, you have the option of working alone, or join in a party, so you can go on quests together, witch holds you accountable. you can customize your character, and get armor, and animals to ride overtime, it has alot to offer compared to other apps, and its free. you cant really beat it. it been around for a long time, so its definitely well liked. its worth a look.",5
63,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Mert İndibi,I really like the app and I've gotten used to it. I think there is a very large room to grow for this app. It has a good desktop support since it can be opened on a desktop browser but a smartwatch app with Wear OS/Huawei store support would be amazing.

My day does not reset at midnight, despite what the app says. When I try to change the reset time to match up with the incorrect timezone, it keeps switching back to midnight. So my day randomly resets, usually around 6 or 7 pm. Sometimes, the day doesn't reset for more than 24 hours. & my avatar takes damage for the ""missed"" day. Makes it impossible to effectively use. :(",1

The reward system of earning XP and items that I'm familiar with in video games really helps keep me motivated as well. My grades have improved as a result, and I even use it for other errands and chores that used to slip my mind easily. The only issues I've had with it have been minor glitches. Definitely worth it! I love this app!",5

There were a few things that were a little confusing to find, but there's a wiki that answers a lot of questions as well as the FAQ. The only reason it doesn't work for me is because tasks feel more like currency than progression. Other task rpg apps either chart your progress or show it as a literal path, which feels more like moving forward. Cute app, but more for those who like armor building in MMOs.",4

Unfortunately it's very unforgiving if you fail your tasks. If you hit zero health the game says you'll lose your progress on your current level but neglects to mention that it also takes all your gold and deletes one of your items. That was enough to get me to quit the app altogether since losing limited gear I worked hard to get was extremely demoralizing.May try it again if they make it less punitive,3
131,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,This app has a fantastic concept that being an MMO style game based around your success in real life. The game is entirely server based and I have a good internet connection but the app would constantly disconnect. I would like a single player mode of some sort no need for like a story or something just something to see your effects in game. So because of the insane amount of server issues I have experienced just using the app for a little but I could not recommend this which is a shame.,3
132,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"This app is a great idea with poor execution. Reminders only sometimes appear, and the UI can be very unresponsive - I've checked daily tasks off, only to find that the app interpreted this as UNchecking the task (since it hadn't registered the fact that it is a new day, yet), which actually subtracts the game resources from you. These problems are significant enough to make the RPG-like rewards system ineffective for me, and the app not worth using as a habit-tracker at this time, sadly.",2

My down points would be (mainly) because of gems. While the game is free, there are certain things you can only get through buying gems. Which is understandable, they need to be able to support themselves&the game. My problem is that while you can earn them for free, it's damn near impossible to compete with 200+ people in one challenge and get rewarded.",4

149,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Liane Silva,"While there is some fun to habit tracking with RPG elements, the app lacks severely in some key aspects. It'd be great to have the ability to organise habits by tags, groups, or colours, and also to set up notification reminders to check if you've fulfilled your habit. It also significantly looses some of its usefulness and fun by encouraging time wasting (unnecessary clicks, clunky menus) and grinding (the diamonds can't be won in any way, and have to be bought, as far as I could tell). A shame",3

I also wish there was a log somewhere so I could check whether or not I've already counted doing my habits.

238,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,The Dess,"I hate the gem system. I absolutely love the app and I've had a generally positive experience. I really think it's one of a kind and gamifying activities is the future. I've been playing for a while and I'm at a pretty high level now, but I can't help to notice that there isn't much left to do at the point that I am. Sure I can level up to infinity. Sure I can talk to people. But there is a lot of repetitiveness and I probably won't stick around for too long. It's too frustrating. The only thing left is to buy fun things with gems so that I can get gold, experience, and some cool rare items. So I decided to grind challenges. And I really did! Actual IRL GRINDING. The result - nothing at all. Why? Because Challenge rewards are luck based and/or rigged most of the time. Sure I did a lotta stuff IRL but not getting rewarded for it in-game kinda ruined it. I don't blame the devs for how Challenge rewards work at all, since rewarding depends on whoever creates the Challenges. But I do think there should be more ways to get gems without paying money. Paying IRL money becomes the only way to continue to have fun at a higher level. That's never a good thing if you want people to stick around. Here are some examples of instances where gem rewards can be implemented: when reaching a certain level, when completing difficult achievements, at a certain number of check-ins, through special in-game events (not RNG based events but events based on the actual effort that you put into tasks, for example). Rewarding the players' efforts is the best way to make them stick around. A balanced relationship between the value of the currency in-game and how difficult it is to get will never stop people from buying it with real money. In many cases it does the opposite. BUT It will also motivate people to progress and continue playing. It's a win win. A lotta people on the app preach the ""it's all about enjoying and improving yourself"" mentality. Sure, but if the aesthetic goal is to ""gamify"" your daily tasks, the app needs to behave like a game, right? And good replayable games are not repetitive and always reward hard work. This might be a bad take and I might be alone on this one but regardless I hope my feedback is useful! and yes, I have no life",4

Although I found it a little confusing to use, not a big deal though, I just had to see two YouTube videos and read a beginner's guide (sarcasm intended). My complaint with it is that it works only online — if I were to make a task while being offline and I connect to internet later, all of those tasks get deleted. This is not a fun thing at all!",3

It makes even getting chores done so much more fun, especially when you're questing with new-found friends, to fight bad habits-bosses and maybe win a special pet or mount!

My only criticism is that you have to use gems to change your class; I selected mage but pretty much immediately realized that I'd already invested a bunch of money into warrior gear and that I'd be better off just going with warrior, but since it's pretty hard to earn gems (I honestly don't know how) I can't change it. It's not a terrible inconvenience besides the fact that I levelled up the available warrior items (like axe and helmet) and now cannot further invest. It's merely disappointing that I'm stuck now. But, besides that, the app is super great. I really like the pets function (I dunno what they do, but they're cute!) and the quests give you some kind of goal to work towards (and thankfully, you can complete them by yourself).

Me: Yes, I've tried that. But making it possible to change the starting day of the week on the browser version (as you can in the app) is apparently not something you want to change. I can only surmise, cause I have not been given any status let alone a confirmation that you've received that request or any request/bug report I've sent. Hence I'm now only wishing, cause I've already tried asking you. Speaking of consistency: Funny you should mention Menu - About - Send Feedback. That ""About"" menu only exists in the app, not on the desktop, and on top of that the ""Send feedback"" does not even exist in the app. It's called ""Report a bug"". In any case, maybe you can send a confirmation in the future at least when request/bug reports are sent that explains what is going to happen with it. Oh, and also ""Report A Bug"" via the app doesn't work (when you don't have a mail app installed I am guessing?). Finding out that you can't even give the proper route as to how to give feedback/bug reports makes me want to substract a star. You've given this canned reply to everyone after all.

I'm much more engaged and focused on getting my tasks done and organizing myself in a way I never thought possible. Having this really makes me want to get my tasks done because there is an actual repercussion for not doing them, i.e., my character losing health. It's a harmless repercussion but one that has just enough impact on me to provide positive motivation.",5

But there seems to be a Bug - I can't seem to receive a friend's Party invite, though I am able to create my own party and invite friends to it. It's a one way street in my app! Joining guilds and the self-care, self-sabotage info have been most educational and helpful.",4

Using negative punishment in tandem with positive reinforcement is a major turnoff, and it feels like I gain no real reward. I deal with that enough in my day-to-day. I also know that I will *almost always* end up skipping taks, and no in-game consequence will help me with that. I want to be rewarded for the stuff I *do* get done, not punished for the stuff I didn't have room or time to finish. Highly anxiety-inducing.",2

588,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Meenakshi Bhardwaj,Just fell in love with the concept of the app..It's like they gamified the plain simple habits app.Makes it more easier to use!(the graphics of the character could be more improved too+there should an option once an activity in dailies/weekly gets completed it could vanish) it'll be less chaotic&more organized and reappear once again in dailies the next day,5

Also, it would be nice to have an option to look for to-dos which include all the tags I'm looking for. eg.

I can only give you a three star rating because suddenly your application no longer functions, with no warning or information as to why or how to fix it. 500 characters is not enough to relay proper data on this issue to the Dev Team, likely by design, and for that I blame Google Play, not the Dev Team of Habitica.",3

1685,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,Sebastian Berg,"This app seems great. i've seen other apps gamifying your life, but what i feels really works, is that you can make a party of friends, and get productive together, while clearing dungeons and getting loot. if you make a group of friends, be aware that even if its just your friends in the group, a single swearword will get you banned. not a warning or anything, straight up banned. i got banned because i called my close friend a F-word C-word. mind you not in public, but in our little group, where that sort of banther is normal between us. Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?",3

Never talk or think of things which you don't want in life.. You yourself would not want anyone to be Rouge. So please give 'ROUGE' SOME positive polish.. If you can. Only a humble suggestion.,5

I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time.  This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.  The avatars are hideous.  The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page. Keyboards won't go away once they pop up. And the list goes on and on...",1

helps me schedule self care when I am just barely functional. I would 
highly recommend it to those wanting to help stay motivated without pushing 
themselves unreasonably hard when they are dealing with a physical or 
mental disability. Your whole list can be scaled back to take it easy on 
you, or you can save up coins to buy yourself a few days off. You can also

far- while you can set dailies to occur on certain days of the week, 
weekly, etc, if these not-quite-dailies have a reminder attached to them, 
the reminder will notify you every day, rather than only on the days the 
daily is scheduled. If this is fixed, the app would definitely earn 5 stars 
from me",4

interface and habit/task tracking is very good, too. I love how there are 3

keep track and get rewarded multiple times. Daily/weekly I use for one-off 
end of day and recurring tasks, such as tidy the kitchen before bed or 
hoover 2x a week . 1 thing I would love if the weekly tasks for example 
would disappear after completing and would only re-appear when they're due 
again!! To-do list is perfect for 1 time tasks. Also love the check list 
and difficulty features!",5

negative or positive effects. And to top it off you get motivated with a 
game avatar to keep your health up for and level up! You can join partys so 
they you can meet people and fogjt bosses just by doing something as simple 
as ""replace toiletpaper."" Not only does it encourage the addition of every 
little task, but it offers a non cluttered way of showing it. I now know 
when I am missing something like meds and water before bed. And if I forgot 
to feed the animals before leaving home. And it keeps me in check. Not only 
do you have fun but you're held accountable by yourself. In a way that 
seems fun and easy. I use both the app and site as they both offer their 
own perks.",5

While the simplicity of the app helps with it's intuitiveness, I would love to see my character walking around/interacting with the environment/simply moving in some way. It'd be great to have the ability to click on our avatar to zoom in/interact with them or the space.  And lastly, more game-like features and content would be awesome. While the app seems to be working towards this, I'd love to have more customization options (especially with my character/inventory) and personal incentives! Maybe our characters could collect and trade objects for our rooms (like in Animal Crossing or The Sims). Anything that allows players who are less into fighting mechanics (me, sadly lol) to have motivation to continue gameplay. Exploration, room expansions, additional features, etc - and more ways to interact and connect with/help motivate my friends who use the app.  Lots of suggestions, but I'll definitely be keeping this app around to see what improvements are made in the future! Keep up the great work!! :D",4

nervous habits like biting my nails, and my sleep schedule has gone from 
sleeping at 4am til 2pm, to consistently sleeping at 11 and waking up at 8

3041,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Excellent idea but poor execution. There really isn't much to do game wise 
especially since the majority of the content is locked behind a paywall. I 
understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users, ad 
impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service 
that locks out the majority of your player base from the start. There's 
also no way to earn crystals other than paying. With so little to do and so 
much unavailable unless you pay (with no options to try before you buy) 
gives me little motivation to come back. Some advice: ●Make the quests you 
can buy with gold cheaper. 200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not 
much to do otherwise. ● Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe 
through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with 
gold). ●Offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks. I 
shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list. ●Have the ability 
to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class 
whenever they'd like. Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a 
grind. ●Have a little more customization available from the start (maybe a 
freeby starter egg or a background or outfit). Literally everything is 
locked behind crystal pay walls...even the character backgrounds are a 
whopping 15 crystals . That just screams greedy.",2

list in exchange for a prize or some other kind of offering on their part. 
This takes out the constant reminders she tries to give me and requests she 
makes of me when I'm not really paying attention and often don't feel like 
taking the time or I'm not in a position to put these new things on my 
to-do list. 2. I see a use for having checklists available in the habits 
category. 3. It would be extremely motivating if there was a way to see a 
list of the things that I've finished and when I finished them. This way I 
can keep track of my productivity overall and perhaps even show someone my 
productivity if it were ever put into question. Also I don't know what to

3188,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"I seriously don't understand. The basic functions of the app are so janky and broken. In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick. Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work. I have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work. Same for the avatar menu. With patience all this stuff does eventually work, but it's tedious to just use the app. The app would be 10 times better just by fixing the buggy menus",2
3189,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"The interface is buggy and hard to understand.

When I finally manage to, my dailies and to-dos don't show up. It's a struggle to mark a daily as completed because it takes forever for the server to recognize that I tapped on the daily.

3252,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"I used to swear by Habitica for a long time, but frankly I find it almost unusable. The biggest, most important problem is the way sync works. You can't use Habitica if offline (or have bad internet connection), you can't click several buttons in quick succession, and you are never sure if clicking a button actually sends data to server, Android widgets are absolutely unusable. Habitica's manual frames it as if it's not their, but user's fault.  I have more than a dozen of Habits and about the same amount of Dailies, most of which are themselves checklists. I keep track of multiple habits, therefore I open Habitica and press + and - many times a day, sometimes several times in an hour. If every time I try to register a Habit or a Daily I must worry about Habitica not syncing properly, then it robs me of time and mental energy. Which makes it useless for actually instilling habits.",2

3257,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,Habitica is great fun and helps me to remind myself of certain things I need to do routinely as well as of single to-dos for the future.

3258,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"So far I'm finding it very helpful and it's a great idea but the app for ui is hugely unintuitive and chunks of it seem not to work at all.  There are buttons that just look like explanatory text and other things that look like buttons that aren't.  If I hatch a new pet or try to make a new change to my avatar it can sometimes take several minutes for the app to recognize and show the change, meanwhile I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong.  The entire party structure and invitation setup is needlessly complicated and frustrating.  The actual task/to do list setup is great. That section of the app is what we're here for and it's really great. The reward and group mechanics are good motivators. It's just the structure of the game that needs improvement.",3

The layout is not very well thought out, I personally don't think the sprites are good looking (albeit that is admittedly a deeply subjective opinion which I am not asking be changed), and the mobile app in particular has a lot of trouble syncing your tasks if you add another task on your PC. I added one to-do to the list on pc yesterday, but it has yet to show up in the app, despite numerous refreshes and attempts to sync the two. That, in my opinion, is a big flaw. Perhaps, in time, it could be a good app. For now, it's merely serviceable. Mediocre. It can certainly be used without major issues, but there is plenty room for improvement.",3

The website can be a bit buggy/laggy at times, but I have had the app for several months and have not run into any issues yet.

And the browser version has some bugs too, sometimes logging in it will display in Pt DESPITE being set to English (I assume it's my browser's settings, but the page's options SHOULD prevail over), and synching will sometimes take gold, health or mana away randomly.

I think it should have the option to add friends to a party by using their user ID instead of scanning the QR code. I have most of my friends in other states so it would be more convenient that way. I also would be nice if it had a notification or pop up telling you when you joined a party or a guild. When you initially click it, it seems like nothing happened and if you click it again it says you be already joined.

3355,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"This app is extremely useful. You have the ability to add/edit habits, daily tasks, and to do. For the habits, you're able set the task to have a positive and/or negative affect on your character. The tutorial example is flossing (I believe).  If you logged that you flossed, you gain experience points and coins. If you logged that you didn't floss, you lose health. The app adds immediate, quantitative consequences to your daily habits.  I only give four stars because, where the concept is amazing, the game can be a bit buggy and I often have to restart it when I'm logging my tasks, buying armor, or looking at additional information in the navigation bar.  I use this app everyday, almost religiously. I love it and have recommended it to my best friend and favorite family members.",4

3370,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Not too bad. It's a great idea but the app is slow.   I had a hard time creating an account and it crashed before the tutorial started.

When I did get to the tutorial, it froze between steps and took a good 5 to 10 minutes to load. Now when I log in for the day, it either takes a while for it to catch up and show the ""start your day"", or it doesn't load at all and my character and party suffer because of it.  On the bright side I'm starting to fall into the habits I want, so it's almost worth it. Some of the graphics look nice, but the character you get to customize looks kinda wonky(?) and the options for it are limited until you can buy more clothes n such with the in-game currency.  If you're willing to spend some time trying to make the app work, then I do recommend trying it out. Otherwise just try the desktop version on their site.",4

It basically makes life much less confusing, by neatly sorting all the things I have to do, and then rewarding me for doing them. Not just in-game rewards, either: you earn gold in the game, and then you can design your own real-life awards that you buy using in-game money (for instance, by spending ten pieces of Habitica gold, you can allow yourself to watch half an hour of television). Obviously you can cheat, by pretending that you've done things that you haven't, and rewarding yourself withoutbhaving earned it, but you'd only be cheating yourself, because the real reward is the progress you've made in your life!

I am aware there are guilds to help you meet parties so you can adventure but I am disinclined to meet strangers just to keep my tasks organized. Also I'll note that the penalties for not engaging in dailies are so minimal that I was never worried about skipping anything... and since the benefits are randomized (apparently heavily towards potion and foods, not eggs) I wasn't incentivized to try for any specific type of activity beyond things I just wanted to get done.",3

3400,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,Good for people with predictable schedules. There should be a way to mark that you don't have a certain task that day because of a snow day for example.

3451,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,I have tried a lot of the productivity apps out there-many of which are fantastic at what they're designed for which is to organize your tasks. Habitica does more though. It actually motivates me as well as providing accountability. Because for some reason just being an adult is not enough motivation. I need to be motivated to find cool pretend animals and remind myself that if I don't do my stuff I'm going to kill my friends. Habitica works for what it's designed for.  That being said it isn't the prettiest or best working app- but it's improving. I have to say I'm impressed overall.,5

3474,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"I was excited to use this app and love the categories and reward system for habits, dailies, to-do. After a few days and several rookie mistakes that aren't explained well in the tutorial, I realized this app is way too heavy on the game mechanics for my use. I want to have a list of dailies to partially complete everyday, to encourage reading and writing every now and then, not everyday. This app punishes you for not checking these things off everyday. I totally didn't realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone. I then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off. I can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task, but it shouldn't be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies (must complete everyday or bonus if completed). They also do not make it easy to provide feedback. All the discussion links either required creating a separate account (different from the habatica account) or were closed threads. This app could be so fun but I feel it loses sight of promoting good habits/organization. I love gaming, but this is super heavy handed mechanics to me. Would keep using this app if I could keep the lists alone.",2

3480,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"This app is totally awesome, but I feel like some of the features encourage procrastination and not completing tasks. I think that red tasks should give less rewards and blue tasks should give more to motivate people to accomplish tasks daily and in a timely manner. I also feel like users should HAVE to earn coins and gems in order to encourage them to do tasks rather than just buy costumes and such with real money.",5
3481,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"I really, really wanted to like this. The concept is genius, but the execution needs a little tweaking. I had a difficult time using the app, because the tutorials were very basic and didn't cover most of what to do. It seemed like if you didn't buy gems, then you couldn't go on quests. I appreciate that the developers need and deserved to be paid for their hard work, but not being able to use most of the rpg elements, negated the motivation to stay productive and use the app. I like the idea of accountability among friends, but the invite system is unusable. It's a QR code and aside from having no idea what to do with it, every time I clicked on it, it downloaded somewhere I couldn't find it on my S8. With a few changes, this could be an amazing app, but it feels like many of the gameplay elements were added as an afterthought to a regular organization app instead of making being productive in real life feel like a game. I love the health system and the seperation of habits and dailies. I also love that you're health decreases when you don't complete a daily task. If the party and questing system were improved, my productivity and appreciation for this app would soar. Please don't stop improving and developing this app. It could be a trendsetter for a whole new genre of games.",3

Is that you can set custom rewards for yourself that you have to buy, with the gold earned from completing the tasks you set and you set how much those custom rewards cost.

The app doesn't show you how many times you've clicked a habit like the counter on the web app. As the app grows, the developers should consider making the rpg elements generic so that they can then be 'skinned' as fantasy/sci-fi etc. To widen the appeal. Finally, guys, you need a different feedback route than trello. It might be a great tool for a development team, but searching through hundreds of cards that are already locked to existing features just to make a suggestion? I couldn't even figure out how to post from my mobile, and decided to say it all here instead.",3
3510,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"I really really want to use this app, but my todo lists keep disappearing. I accidentally checked one off in the widget and it's gone. Not in completed, not showing up in any filter, just gone. Then a few hours later, another todo with several sub items just plain vanished. I don't even know what I did this time to make it disappear. I love the concept and the design, but a task app that loses my tasks is pretty much a waste of time.",2
3511,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"I absolutely love this app...but if I could have 2 things improved, I would definitely add the ability to make lists instead of tags and the ability to have reoccurring to-dos instead of having it in the dailies section. If these features were there, it would be the most perfect app ever.",5
3512,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"When I check off to dos they don't actually go away until I refresh the page, and new pets hatched seem to take a long time to load. Otherwise all in all a great way to Gamify Your tasks.",4
3513,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Cool and fun concept. But I stopped using it because the app always checks for connection. This affects usability when you are often offline because if you use the app, you will always fet prompted that you are not connected. It would be better if sync is transparent; no prompts if offline.",3
3514,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Wonderful potential and with excellent content but not very well executed. UI poor & buggy; connectivity & state-saving bugs; unintuitive & hazy. However, still a tremendous tool with (I don't use this term lightly) life-changing potential despite! I feel as though the gamification aspect is tangential but foundational to the system design. If the user relies on the superficial static pixel-art RPG as the primary mechanic incentivizing their real-world habits, tasks & challenges, they'll plateau real fast, as there isn't much substance to the 'game' side. The social/game features (custom avatars &c.) are steeply ramped to try to drive pay-for-play schemes, so the appeal to some of a casual showoff/hangout sort of play are curtailed. Some of the user-contributed content (mostly in Challenges but also in general chatpost/Tavern) is excellent; imagine self-help style microlessons but from evidence-based and therapeutically-sound sources, as well as plenty of great personal strategic content and tips from a range of people suffering from a variety of impediments to routine/studying/self-care/productivity/etc. sharing what's worked for them. Incredible, and there's also arts exposure, bookclubbing, hobbyisting, and more being done through the system as well. Bottom line is same as the top: This has awesome potential to (actually) help people improve their lives but the system isn't designed very well and on top of that the app isn't up to professional standards.  Don't have it? Get it, and start it. Try it for a couple weeks if you can. Keep reading...",3

This concept is amazing, and the idea is just brilliant. However, this is by far the buggiest app I've ever had on my Android, and the UI is just not well thought of. Guys, please work on the bugs so I won't have to click 1,000 times before I get feedback that something happened, won't have to reopen the app and lose all the initial welcome tour with all the choices, won't have to use my full name without being able to change it because I signed up with Google....

A majority of internet users don't use full browsers to surf it. So this app had to be good, because your habits are a private and important thing. And it's absolutely not good. The last (but not only) straw was when parts of a menu are rendering in completely the wrong place, and won't clear. Inviting people to your party was way too confusing, until I found out it didn't even work until I did it manually *on the site*. There's more, but I won't bother.

There are occassional technical difficulties where the app will stop working or have a slow response time, but I doesn't get in the way of the overall usage.  Really enjoy the level of customization in terms of costumes and equipment and being able to link yourself with your friends to complete tasks definitely makes the app more engaging.

I know that might be a nother app, but if the widget had functionality it could be used, via an android wear app called Widget, that let's you put your widgets on your watch.  Currently the only widget that is functional is the habit widget since you only need to click the button, but dailies and todos require opening and checking the lists which the widget can't do.   Updating the widget would cover both widget users and watch users. It would work great if there was only one widget that you swipe left and right to move through habits, todos, and dailies, up and down to move through tasks in each category, and adding the option to expand and click checkboxes.",4

From my experiences with friends, it doesn't work for everyone, but it works well for me.   I would strongly encourage giving it a shot!  4/29: after recent update app has improved. I still prefer the desktop website. I would really love to see the streak counters on habits the same way the website does.

I eat healthier, I stick to routines better, I learn more because I sign up for fun challenges...I love it and tell people about it all the time!  I will note that the app is slightly buggy in that when I have an item with a checklist and I'm checking things off on my phone, the app will pretty often uncheck them about five seconds after I've checked them, so I have to keep tapping those checkboxes and then the app--and I--get confused and checklists get completed without all their items checked off. Not sure if I'm explaining it clearly, but I'm getting a new phone soon and hopefully that will help solve the issue.

Now when you add or edit a habit or daily , the change is not reflected immediately in the list. You have to press sync manually to see the new habit/daily. After you delete a habit, it will still show up in the list and when you press on the deleted item, the new task activity will show up unless you sync manually. This will make the UI extremely confusing. it will be much better if you simply do a sync automatically in the background whenever a new habit or daily is added. If you fear that it will hit the server too hard then at least update the UI list probably and sync later. It is a very good app. It's sad to see a small problem hurting the overall experience.",4

The only reason I use this app is for the sake of quests? Because everything else is so boring. But even the quests are dull. And if you're in a big party, they don't even scale it properly? There's nothing like having a quest start and then having it finish a couple hours later before you even have a chance to do anything. Not to mention it totally lacks the ability remind you of anything. All it does is nag you everyday at a set time. That's all it's capable of. Set a to do with a due date? Great but you won't get a reminder about it. Not to mention the fact that it still doesn't allow any form of offline capabilities. And they just make up excuses for why they can't have it.

This is an application that transforms operant conditioning into an easy and fun to use tool to shape your behavior and obliterate procrastination. Tasks that once used to take weeks to even consider doing, I do almost every day. You form the program to your exact needs and goals. The party feature also adds in a social aspect that is both fun and a source of accountability. I have the high praises for Habitica.",5
4015,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"This is a great app. I have been using it for several months, it really helped me a lot. One thing I want is more engaging gamification: right now the rewards are not really immediate, it really discourages me when I lose all my health points and my avatar drops a level. Also, I hope the app can be better integrated with other apps like Google Fit, Lose It, etc.",5

4017,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Awesome app that made/kept me ridiculously motivated to finish tasks I would normally neglect or keep procrastinating. It also keeps me on track and now I actually not only set goals, but also reach them!  I totally recommand Habitica to all, especially cosplayers, gamers with a backlog and people with a depression and/or a procrastination problem!",5

I thought the gameyfication was going to be silly, but it's turned out to be a lot of fun and quite encouraging! The interaction with the party I joined is very helpful also. You're not alone. Great feature! The only reason I'm giving the app a 4 and not a 5 is because it does lack a few of the features found on the Web site, however, the app does stand well on its own.",4
4019,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Habitica new slogan should be: ""If you want to get things done"". Seriously, no other app had the same impact in my life as Habitica does it makes it all fun at the same time it pressures you to walk on the line. And you can improve and succeed at any given subject or life area. All you have to do is set a habit/daily/to-do and classify it into a category of your choice.  You can interact with other groups of people playing the game, and you can get into challenges.  I already feel better after using for just a couple of weeks.   They just sent a new update so I'll give you a better review after a month or so of deliberate use.   Don't download other apps. Don't download to-do lists, habit trackers and similar apps. Download habitica, it makes you get things done.  Awesome productivity app. Should be a top developer.",4

I have a good one for you guys, add onClick action to health bar and Exp bar and show a history of whats been happening there (what made up go up or down) .   Ps.

If you're struggling with keeping on track with the tasks in your life, I highly recommend giving this a try.",5

4142,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Either start with the app or forget it. I downloaded this to make it easier for me to keep up with dailies rather than turn on my computer just to log in my completed tasks. Instead, the app messed up my dailies timeline, causing me to wrongly take damage in battles and in turn killing my character. Some of the dailies appear on the wrong days, ruining my habits that this game has helped me build. In short, start with the app, but if you started on computer, stay with it.",3

I was proven wrong, it really helps! The bonus is that you can have a support system consisted of real people when you join parties and guilds.   Only problems I have with the app are the glitches and errors that occur, such as the tags, not appearing, and items not syncing properly after I have used them. I didn't know what to do except go to settings and force stop the app. Sadly that caused the glitches and errors to become frequent. I finally Uninstalled/reinstalled the app, only to discover to same non-appearring tags glitch. Please fix this.",3

Love the new widgets. =) It's great to be able to see a list of dailies waiting to be done on my home screen and to be able to tick them off while I'm out and about without having to even open the app,5
4306,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"The only list that comes with a community. I keep my lists in Habitica, and the little step-by-step processes towards being the person I want to be. Been using Habitica almost a month, and many notice a difference in my productivity and attitude towards mundane stuff.  I was worried about the ""game"" aspect because I have a tendency to ... obsess. But each 'quest' is a text-based little paragraph story that progresses a little bit every day based on how much of your list you or your 'party' group check off.  It's either collecting things or beating up some sort of monster, and it literally takes as little time as you want it to.  The $5 in-game purchases are cosmetic, not needed at all. But the $ does go towards improvements. There are two improvements I would like -- monthly or weekly recurring to-dos that don't clutter up your list, and adding checklists to challenge tasks.",5
4307,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"Idea is great and I love using this app, but parts need refining. Sorting items (ToDos, Dailies, etc) from the app doesn't persist, but doing so from the website does. There is a widget for Habits and Dailies, but not for ToDos, and I this ToDos is the list people would best like to see made into a widget. There is no clean way to take back a button press (If you accidentaly pressed on + and didn't mean to your options are leave it as is even though you didn't earn the rewards or edit the task to include a minus option and take the HP hit). Would be nice if you could automatically sort by Due Date ascending. Creating a Daily and setting it to all days, then editing it and removing the current day still leaves the Daily Active (Same with the reverse if it was first created as not enabled for this day of the week, then editing and enabling it, it remains disabled). Etc , My point is the idea is amazing, there is a huge community behind it which is great, and I personally love the app. But it lacks polish around the edges and some bugs could be fixed.",3

Other habit tracking/ to-do apps I have used previously failed to keep me motivated and so I quickly fell behind on my tasks.

Not finishing dailies has just as high an effect, you continue to make meager amounts of gold (which is hardly worth anything when you need to buy gems to do quests or get any cool gear), and you lose gear *and* a level with every lost health bar.

The ""pause your dailies"" button is a little hindering sometimes, though it is my choice to use it. I think a better option would be a vacation mode, where normal dailies are paused, and you can still earn points by doing them, but can't lose health, and habits and to-dos won't change colors, but you can still earn points.

The idea to separate habits, dailies, to-do and then rewards is brilliant.

The quest system, while not being perfect, allows me and my kids to enjoy seeing our work on tasks produce some results. The whole system does have some draw-backs, although being a community project, it understandable. The main drawback for me is the options for recurrance of tasks. You can either select the days for it to occur on by themselves, or select for it to repeat every x number of days. This is workable, however, certain tasks need to be done on certain days of the month, and since each month has a different amount of day, saying to repeat every 30 days does not work perfectly.

4540,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,Tbh I think this is a great concept but there is one problem. It's super easy for me to cheat myself and check off the item eventhough I haven't done it 😂 so I think it can be better if the app asks the user to snap a picture of the finished item so it actually motivates the user more to actually complete the task instead of cheating themselves,4

At poor connectivity, my laptop sometimes get a perpetual loading screen on the website. The website will just load on forever.  3) I had one instances where my app and website completely does not sync up. It never happened beyond that, so maybe just so random bad luck on my part.

4856,com.habitrpg.android.habitica,A Google user,"A world of difference!  Some time ago, I downloaded this app when it was still called HabitRPG. It was clunky and in early development so I didn't hold onto it for long. Never would I have guessed that, over two years later (give or take) it would have developed so much! The outlay is beautiful and aesthetically appealing. There are a plethora of things to do within the app itself with that list ever-growing. I am very fond of the checklists that have become a central focus as well.   As a novelist, there are many pieces to the writing process. Many apps lack the option to list in parts which quickly becomes problematic. Instead of neatly being able to find a certain item, I am stuck digging through either the list itself or tags to find it. That is ten minutes or more of wasted time. Habitica allows me to organize everything neatly, filing it away beneath one point. Perfect for long-standing novels, shopping lists and more!  A fantastic app. Congratulations on your success, Habit!",5

complete are meaningful, purposeful, tangible - not like I'm doing them

If I try to set multiple reminders for a task, it seems like it would allow it, but then it discards the second reminder time and only saves the first one. Moving tasks up and down the list doesn't work properly (lags and jitters). Tapping refresh puts them back in their original order making re-sequencing them pointless. Which brings me to another point: refresh has to be tapped constantly to see changes that you make. I created a habit and it seemingly disappeared right after hitting save and wouldn't appear until I refreshed. Also, how do I hear the theme song? I can change it in the settings but tapping each option simply changes which one is active. How am I supposed to know which theme I want if I can't preview it? Another problem is the tutorial: tapping the menu items at the bottom didn't always activate each sections tutorial. For example, I tapped on To-do and created some items, then went to Rewards, saw that tutorial, went back to To-do, and then the app decided to display the tutorial for To-do. Making tasks, habits and goals like an RPG is a great idea. But honestly, I think most people would get frustrated at this clunky interface and just give up after 5 or 10 minutes like I did.",2

The daily exp cap could at least be some kind of a max gauge meter point, which would be a good decision helper in terms of ""how much exp should i get for doing X"" and distributing your daily task load.  3)it takes progressively more exp for new levels and it only makes sense in mmo, not real life. Irl it depends very much on what you're doing, and getting less levels for doing same things could be demotivating.  4)need better char models and more customization.
