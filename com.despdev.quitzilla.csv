0,com.despdev.quitzilla,Justin,"I like the simplicity of the app; and though some customization and home screen widgets are locked behind the pro version, I think this is a great app with a very simplistic UI. As a Programmer myself, I would have to say that this has been built very well and so far I haven't experienced any hiccups or software issues with the app. My only gripe, and this is just because I'm frugal, is the pricing of the Premium version. 4.99 just seems a lot to me to unlock basic customization options.",4
1,com.despdev.quitzilla,Rachel Golden,"Wanted an app similar to tracking sobriety, but didn't need something drug/alcohol related. Found this one...love it! I think its cool that you can create custom ""bad habits"", and name them whatever you want. They have some preset options as well. You can also input the general cost of a habit, and it tracks how much money you've saved while abstaining. Also, the software is user friendly and intuitive; overall very easy to use. Super happy with it.",5
2,com.despdev.quitzilla,Ashley Mohundro,This app has started helping me very quickly. I love seeing your progress in the style of percentages and your abstinence time increasing by the second. I have an obsession with my right eyebrow. I love to touch it and pick the hairs out sometimes too with my fingernails. Much of the time I've been doing it while completely unaware. I'm now catching it the moment I do it and stop immediately to go in and reset the timer. This is training my brain nicely. Thanks!,5
3,com.despdev.quitzilla,Sara M.,"Everything is great !! Very easy to use and is very helpful! Love all the features ; the notifications, the rewards , the tracking of my progress, the list of reasons as a reminder and the encouraging quotes!! I have a lot of hope that this is gonna help me abstain from the bad habit that I wanna quit. Thank you !! I've knocked off a star because I'm just not a fan of the ads.",4
4,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,Wow. such a fantastic app! I didn't mind paying the one time payment for the upgraded version which gives you unlimited addictions. I love the way it tracks money as well as time spent on addictions. I am a competitive person and my favorite person to compete with is me... it really helps me stay focused on my goals of sobriety and the daily reminders and quotes keep me moving forward.,5
5,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Great app but it leaves more to be desired. In order to quit something, the event needs to be replaced with something else. I think adding an event/goal tracker for positive change would make a great addition to the app. I have been doing that on my own account but I feel it would be the perfect implementation for such an amazing app! I bought premium and was not disappointed :)",5
6,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"4/17/19(Day one) So far so good. It has a nice clear layout and I like the motivational quotes. 4/23/19 Removing two stars because 1. To get widget, I have to buy app. 2. Putting a note in the calender resets the counter. It would be nice if the reset was optional. I would like to be able to just type about my urges and how I dealt with them. It's odd to have a calender that allows notes but the notes are only for failures and reset the counter.",4
7,com.despdev.quitzilla,Cliff Horowitz,"I like the simplicity of the interface. The only thing I wish it provided was a historical list of spans. You can see this in the calendar, but a scrollable list in text format could give a long-view snapshot without scrolling through months. Small point though. It's great otherwise.",4
8,com.despdev.quitzilla,Isiah Thomas,This may seem like a petty complaint but.... I gladly bought the full version of the app to track a third addiction... but noticed the counter only displays in days. And you can't change it to show years+months (as far as I could tell) Which is very awkward. Great app otherwise. But I did return it because I really just want to be able to glance and know what I'm looking at. If I'm mistaken or this is added I'll again gladly come back!,4
9,com.despdev.quitzilla,Rick Rummell,"It's a simple app that tracks the time of your habits. It gives you several options of habits to pick from, but allows you to make custom habits. It monitors money spent on your habits which would be good for a smoker, or binge shopper, it also tracks time waisted on other bad habits. It's pretty user-friendly, and customizable. It's a good app, and I can't really think of much more that can be done to better it.",5
10,com.despdev.quitzilla,Lain Jackson,"Mental Health MUST! I downloaded this app to help me track and deter me from certain compulsions (OCD). Honestly, after a decade of struggling with this compulsion, this is the best tool I've used by far! I just purchased the unlimited app so I could add more habits. It's well designed, easy to use, and I'm motivated to keep using it because it keeps me accountable to myself.",5
11,com.despdev.quitzilla,Bah√≠a Hefner,"I really like being able to glance at the app to see my progress... Even if it is minutes and hours! The only reason I didn't give it give stars is the price to pay for a dark theme and to have a widget. I wish it was a little lower in price ($.99-1.99 seems reasonable) but $5 is steep for some folks. Other than that, it's a good app/tool to assist with sobriety.",4
12,com.despdev.quitzilla,Katherine Melton,"This app is very simple but they are sleeping on a possible use for it! Along with tracking abstainance from substance, I have also been using it to track when I've taken my daily medication, which I have a tendency to forget! You can log it on the calendar the same way as you do your substance/habit you are avoiding using/doing. I can look at the calendar and check if I've taken my pill so that if I've forgotten I don't double dose myself! I dont like that there are only 2 tracking slots 4 free",3
13,com.despdev.quitzilla,Katelyn Acrey,I like it but the ads were freaking way too much. I ended up buying the sub for no ads because I had free Google money....but it's like 6.50 to get no ads or some like that....6.50-$7 pretty much but besides that I like the app I like being able to track my progress with current bad habits that need help quitting. Not a good app to keep track of quit days as the max track time is 5 years,5
14,com.despdev.quitzilla,Mary Esche,"Great app, only thing I don't like is the fact that your clean time is only shown as a percentage towards your next goal. I'd like to be able to just glance at it and know how long I've been clean without doing advanced level math",3
15,com.despdev.quitzilla,jandj jandj,"This helped me successfully quit one habit I was struggling with and I plan to use it for others. The progress bar is really motivational and I enjoy the daily quotes. Simple app but genuinely effective and useful, thank you!",5
16,com.despdev.quitzilla,Harry Baker,"Really simple and Lovely app to track things. Would love to be able to see analytics on cycles being broken, time, day, month etc :)",5
17,com.despdev.quitzilla,Lucy Walsh,Super simple to use. No annoying/disruptive ads! Good daily reminders and quotes to stick to your goal!,5
18,com.despdev.quitzilla,Daniel Belton-Simmons,"Works brilliantly, although the app doesn't need premium and is great as a standalone product without premium with very little ads, imma get premium, the devs deserve my money. Awesome app",5
19,com.despdev.quitzilla,Maxwell Anderson,does what it says on the tin. Simple and useful. Would like to see social integration so i can support the homies achieving goals,5
20,com.despdev.quitzilla,Abo Bader,One of the best application! I owned all achievements! More than 10 years without soda drinks. Now I can feel my goals and dreams.,5
21,com.despdev.quitzilla,Matthijs Walhout,"This app is incredible for tracking your progress in quitting bad habits. It gives you motivational quotes, achievements, and all sorts of features that make quitting bad habits a lot easier and more fun. It is also nice that the premium version is a one-time purchase, I bought it since I really enjoy the app but I hate being stuck to subscription based models and I'm sure a lot of people would agree with me on that.",5
22,com.despdev.quitzilla,caden,"Really great app to keep track of problematic addictions. I also really like that premium is a one time fee and not a monthly subscription. There a couple things that I don't like, first one is the lack of widget customizing, it would've been really nice to add more info on the widget and change colors and opacity. Another is the fact that there is no way to see the exact day that a timer ends. Other than these it's a really great app that delivers in it's promises.",5
23,com.despdev.quitzilla,Jennie Corvidae,"Meh. Paid for the full version, nothing different than the free version except you can track more than 2 habits. Switched phones and the app deleted my records, so why did I pay for the full version? Also, you can't change your start date if you entered it wrong. You have to make a whole new tracker again. Overall, lame but whatever... I already paid for it. I guess it does what it says; tracks your habits. That's about it. *eye roll*",2
24,com.despdev.quitzilla,jared hites,Simple and easy to use. The daily quotes are actually really halpful,5
25,com.despdev.quitzilla,Lucas Cardella,"Easy setup, and helps keep you motivated, feels funny seeing ads mid crisis tho",4
26,com.despdev.quitzilla,Paul Kramer,A $5 one time fee is absolutely worth the help needed to chang your mind.,5
27,com.despdev.quitzilla,Elizabeth Borcherds,"It says nothing about premium in the app description apart from Google telling you the price (it is the only in-app purchase). The free version only allows you to track two bad habits. However so far, the graphics are good and you can choose the exact time that you quit. There is always a motivational quote at the top. I would suggest adding more miscellaneous icons without names attached for unusual addictions.",4
28,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I'm a free user of the app and relatively new to it. I think one of the best feautres is the motivation board where the reason to quit can be put in, to check up when temptation arises. The daily quote is a good feature. Also, notifying the milestones and automatic tracking investible time and using it as a resource is a good feature. I like the app and would definitely recommend it.",5
29,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"An average experience. Free version allows only 2 habits at a time, which is okay and I would still have given it a 5 star. These types of apps are best when used for 1 or 2 habits at a time. HOWEVER, you get bombarded with the same adds. The adds are okay, as they are audiobooks, but the volume is insane sometimes as often as every 3 or 4 clicks on the interface. I've heard the snippet of the witcher audio book over 5 times in less than a days use.",3
30,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I imagine for some seeing a clock tick might be annoying, but I just like to certain % towards getting through a week and such. I only downloaded it yesterday so this is only like my second time looking at it. Even if it just helps a little bit, it all goes towards making giving up a little bit easier. Good luck to you all, you can do it! x",4
31,com.despdev.quitzilla,Lauren,"I really love this app, but I think there's one thing missing that would make it perfect - i would love to be able to add an event with both a start and stop time eg started drinking at 7pm stopped at 12am. This would make the streak tracker so much easier and more accurate. Atm if im working on a habit im still struggling with I have to add second event so that the start time for the new streak is accurate. But I really love the money saved feature! So inspiring!",5
32,com.despdev.quitzilla,Boris B,"It's a good app. The ads are barely noticeable, the UI is easy to use, and it does the job. The only personal downside is two free ""addiction trackers"". I feel like an additional third would satisfy most. But two is plenty enough for some already. It's an app I've been searching for, for a long time. Highly recommended to those whom want to quit their addictions or nasty habits, as well as for people that like to set personal challenges.",4
33,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"An absolutely great app, but - I bought premium mainly because it was stated that you can choose ""unlimited rewards"" what lead me to believe that I can choose rewards for reaching one week for example. But it seems it's only possible for addictions you have to spend money for. My fault, but still disappointing. I would be happy if that would be a future option + individual achievements (names + time).",3
34,com.despdev.quitzilla,Krista Ann,I really enjoy this app as it is simple and helps me keep myself accountable. I started with the free version for smoking but paid to add more choices. I also use it to track how often I do good things like walking the dog and yoga. I would love to see a version where you can track that kind of streak as well. But thus works just fine too ü•∞,5
35,com.despdev.quitzilla,Jason Stanley,Tho I still struggle with certain vices this app really does help in keeping track of any progress I am making :),5
36,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I like the concept of this app and I haven't found a lot of similar app yet. But I'm dissapointed by the fact that, the display on the widget is delayed and not real time. This is dissapointing. Also, the counting is also delayed. For example I set the streak from 00:00. When the time in the clock is 00:10, usually the displayed is still 00:09. So there is slight delay. I know this is minor. But I'm quite perfectionist, and I also expect perfection as close as possible as I've paid for this app.",3
37,com.despdev.quitzilla,Kaitlyn Laine (Kaye),Honestly it's awesome. I wish they would have the reverse goal possible as well. I would like the option to be able to achieve stuff. I want to be able to do both that and quit something and have it be in the same app as this. I know seperate apps exist but I'm not an app heavy person as are many others. (It's such a drain on the battery and time to do too much.) So please I will rate five and/or pay for premium for this added feature!!!,4
38,com.despdev.quitzilla,Josh Desmond,"Cool concept but it's a paid app even though it is marketed as free. It wasn't until I went to add a third vice that the app finally notified me for the first time that premium is required to do so. For such a simple app I'm just going to find a free alternative, (and one not riddled with ads either).",2
39,com.despdev.quitzilla,James Jessen,"I like that it's generalized for any addiction, the sleek minimalist design and the widgets. You do have to pay $5 for the dark theme and tracking multiple addictions though. The cost seems steep for such a simple app, but it's much less expensive than their top competitor.",5
40,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Easy to use and very customisable, the increasing abstinence periods (1 day > 3 days > 1 week, etc) make it easy to see how far you've come and make each milestone a realistic thing once you've accomplished the previous one. This, combined with the fact that all the necessary features are available in the free versions, makes this app one of the few apps I might upgrade to premium just to support the devs.",5
41,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Most apps I've used that help you keep ci a bad habit, in my case nail biting. I've not found useful as they've made me feel bad when I fail. But this one helps keep you on track, allows you to choose your own time frame, make a personalised list of motivations and reasons to quit your habit, and has a trophies to work towards which has helped me stay on track and encourages me to keep going.",5
42,com.despdev.quitzilla,91gold91,"In my own opinion, this is the best app if you want to quit any bad habit. This app has a lot of useful things that doesn't have almost all another apps like that. For example, for me it is very important to see the day when you ""make report"" (here it shows you, day and time. When I used a lot of apps like that , there were any opportunity to set correctly time , only date). I think, that's was main difference. However, the design quite poor and a little bit boring:(",5
43,com.despdev.quitzilla,Andrew Hahn,Glad I found this. Probably will upgrade on payday because of all the money I'll be saving from abstinence.,5
44,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Purchased it immediately. It is very simple and do its task with simplicity. Add what you want to quit, the abstinence start and thats it. Sometimes too much is not good. Kudos to the devs. Maybe a good additional is a reminder whether the user committes the act again. I'll give 5 stars when the feature becomes available. Keep improving but keep everything simple!",4
45,com.despdev.quitzilla,Ewald den Dopper (EdD089),"I expected a bit more features and options, but it's rather good. Good and easy UI, everything is clear and easy, cold figure out fast how it works. Edit: although it was logged in with Google Play, it did not back up my progress, lost everything.",2
46,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"This application is indeed very useful. However, the free version is substantially limited, as such as I cannot even change the theme of the application. I recommend that some banal features such as these should be allowed to all the version, being either free or pro. Nonetheless, I really liked it. I think I will be buying the pro version when I reach my home country. „Åì„ÅÆ„Ç¢„Éó„É™„ÅØ„Å®„Å¶„ÇÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Å†„ÄÇ",4
47,com.despdev.quitzilla,Bart Watkins,Almost 300 days sober. This app has been of more help than you can ever realize on my journey to quit drinking. I couldn't tell you the last time I ever went this long in the last 20 years of heavy drinking. So thank you for that. The only thing I would change with this app would be the badges. I would love to see some more between the 1 and 5 year. Being able it see at least a 2 and 3 year mark I think would be really encouraging to stay on track. Thanks again.,5
48,com.despdev.quitzilla,ivan acevedo,"good if you're not easily infuriated at the sight of ads like i am, or if you don't mind paying for premium to get rid of the ads, but honestly it's such a simple concept for an app that you'd be better off just writing your relapses down on paper or something instead of paying for what is essentially a timer with a pretty UI, stats and quotes.",4
49,com.despdev.quitzilla,Tam C,"Helps alot ,feels like you have good support",5
50,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Got it, started using it and bought premium. Overall it's a great app - simple yet with just enough options for customisation to satisfie my pedantry. Visual minimalism is highly pleasing - main screen has nothing that is unnecessary. Google drive sync is a gr8 feature and quote of the day is a bit cheesy yet actually a welcome upbeat. I also finally found the statistics for each goal, that I somehow overlooked XD, that give me a welcome sense of control! Greate app!",5
51,com.despdev.quitzilla,Cory Bouchard,"Good app to keep track of your relapses and see the progress between two addictions. You can only have two addiction with the base app it's all you really need for it function although I wish the pro features were free cause this could help lots of people if they weren't limited and pushed away at the price of the $7.33 CAD pro edition. Almost $10 for a app designed to help people but, they need money. Unlike all the other tracker apps that are usually set to one specific addiction. Best I found",4
52,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Great for tracking and reminding us when trying to quit a bad habit. If you had a kind of notebook or journal feature, that would be perfect. Writing a daily log I think is very helpful when quitting something, so you should have that feature to help. If you have that feature, that would make the 5th star.",4
53,com.despdev.quitzilla,Rob White,"This is an awesome app that's helping me to quit my bad habits. It does the counting for you and lets you focus on disciplining yourself. It isn't judgy and it helps you think positive. One suggestion; I think it would benefit from a notification you could click if you were feeling tempted to do the bad habit, that would show you your reasons for quitting.",4
54,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,Absolutely love the app. Only thing that would have made it even better would have been the ability to make a note on the calendar rather than making the data inputted result to a relapse. Giving the option of relapse or just a general note would work great so you can track how you feel and use that information to avoid relapsing. Please consider this and update this as soon as possible. I really love this app and want it to be the best ! Once this is done I'll give 5*. Thank you!,4
55,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I really like the app, but I wish I could put a specific date to reset the timer as I do it a bit later. I would like to add in notes also for days and times that occured before the reset time but I can't currently. Other than those two things, the app has been helpful. I like the quotes it has. They are encouraging",3
56,com.despdev.quitzilla,PIYUSH KUMAR,"The app is good. I would recommend the developers to add a feature in which we can record notes related to a particular day, like on what day it was the toughest to control yourself and how we overcome it. As per the available features we can only record notes when we break the habit and not on any other day.",4
57,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"It's an amazing app for tracking your sobriety time. It counts hours, mintues and secounds so you know exact amout of sobriety to the T. It also gives daily insperational quotes, it gives y ou milestones updates (chips) it also lets you list reasons why you don't want to use anymore so you can go back and, look at them when you need reminding or you can add somethinh new when you think of it.

60,com.despdev.quitzilla,Josiah Robinson,"I haven't used this app very long, but the value was immediately apparent. Gratification is such an important tool. Gratifications usefulness stems from it's powerful ability to modivate. No wonder we live in a world centered on instant gratification, It works. negative goals are challenging In part because it easier to feel accomplished/gratified doing something rather than not. For me makes it feel like I am doing something, I'm racking up time. I feel gratified seeing the time I accumulated.",5
61,com.despdev.quitzilla,Stiaan Barnard,Very nice app. Good design and very user friendly. It's worth pay for the premium version and I promise you won't regret it. You can add as many additions or bad habits as you want and the widget makes it very easy to keep track of the most important one so that you can always stay motivated. I would highly recommend downloading Quitzilla and trying it for free for a few days. Then buy it and you'll see that it's money we'll spent. No ads No need to sign up or create any accounts. Easy to use.,5

63,com.despdev.quitzilla,Asap Moa,I really like the app and in the early stages of killing my bad habits it helped me gauge how long I could go before a relapse. Because of this I would know when my urge is at the highest peak and prepare myself beforehand. The option to write journals on the Calendar would be a great addition. It would help users to write the positive changes they acquire or trigger elements etc.,4
64,com.despdev.quitzilla,Jon Snyder,"Good app, but would love to be able to see a line or bar graph of the time between resets. That way I can see if my abstinence spans are increasing on average. The line graph of the money spent is not as helpful since that isn't the main reason I'm quiting.",5
65,com.despdev.quitzilla,Brooke Lowe,"Its a pretty good app, I like the percentage thing for the goal, it makes it feel more like an achievement. I wish the app widget would have that progress bar too, as I think just seeing it on my phone screen as the curved bar would help alot.",5
66,com.despdev.quitzilla,Viktorija Remizova,"I enjoy this app. The only thing I don't like that it states a kinda target for abstinence rather than just showing how long I've been abstaining. I haven't drunk alcohol for 2.5 years, the app shows a target of 5 years and 50% complete. I feel some distress because my target is to never drink again and it's devastating to think that I may start again after 5 years. That's the only reason why I have given 4 stars.",4

And right after the app shows an ad of some new video game ü§£ something is deeply wrong with the behavioural design here. The fact that you need money for development doesn't change the fact that there's a fatal flaw in the app's very logic. You can't position yourself as a tool that helps to fight addictions and monetize these addictions at the same time. Not free. Not evil. Just useless. Money making beats the helping part,1

This app has 1 flaw, there's no organizational component in this. I want to quit bad fitness habits, school habits, etc. I want to be able to organize these habits in a folder instead of having like 12 things on the front page.

Only wish they had a little more information on the app. Maybe on top of the quotes add some information related to the specific addiction. Have things relevant to quitting along with the milestones maybe?

82,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,I bought this app because you had to pay a fee for getting premium membership which would give you an option to add a widget to your screen which helps you track the abstinence time. But the widget doesn't update the time so i would request everyone not to buy the premium version unless this gets fixed. A total bummer!!,2
83,com.despdev.quitzilla,Zack Dean,Easy and simple to keep track of your progress. Don't like the ads every now and then. But since I see myself using this pretty often. I figured I'd go on and get the premium version for $5. Just wish there wasn't ads on here.,4
84,com.despdev.quitzilla,Colm Blake,Simple app to track your progress,4
85,com.despdev.quitzilla,Rose Frankie,Cannot open the app due to constant crashing. This is really upsetting as I have been using this app to track my sobriety for years and I really don't want to lose all of the data on my progress :(,1
86,com.despdev.quitzilla,Rachel Root,"I wish you could use your own phone emojis for habit symbols, and I wish there were more color options for habits, but love this app! Works great! I'm trying to stop nail picking/biting, lying, eye picking, and swearing. It lets you mark what time you relapsed in the past, such as what time, which is nice. The widgets are great too!",5
87,com.despdev.quitzilla,Madilyn Bunderson,I have loved this app so far! So much that I'm actually writing a review üòÖ. The app is very easy to use and it doesn't constantly nag you with notifications. It also keeps your goal out of the few notifications it does send so that others can't see what you're trying to quit if they see your phone. Overall great app! 10/10 would recommend!,5
88,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I love this app, by far the best app for quitting anything, I'd highly recommend it! the only thing I would really change is to have the option to see things in years once it's been that long. I'm over a year with one of my bad habits, and it's quite hard to keep track of it as it's showing it all in days! If this were an option it would be 5 stars definitely. I hope to see this change soon!",4
89,com.despdev.quitzilla,Unknown Unknown,"There is a bug where ive added a habit on 00:00, 5 hours later it shows for example 04:59.37. And the habits don't sync in time, For example they should get +1 second at the same time. It's a great app and the quotes are cool, But even if I don't 'shake' the phone it changes quotes. Hope uou guys can fix it and make this app even better.",5
90,com.despdev.quitzilla,Sam,Simple with a clean interface. Most sobriety apps require a monthly subscription for the premium version but this is just a one time payment of $4.99. Definitely recommend.,5
91,com.despdev.quitzilla,Sam Meds,"I've been using this app since 2018 and I tell many other people that might benefit, to try it! I like the daily quotes, and the amounts of money saved. I also really like the % of time to a certain month milestone it has ; like 45% to 6 months etc. Good app, I appreciate the help!",5
92,com.despdev.quitzilla,Rafiel Saavedra,"Very good and clean interface. Motivational messages and accurately keeps track of the time spent sober in a huge variety of different addictions, even video game addiction. The ads really detract from the experience though, making my disease feel like something to be monetized.",4

95,com.despdev.quitzilla,Oj Kiuy,Love your app. Thank you for your work,5
96,com.despdev.quitzilla,Human Person,This app has really helped me stop shmeating my meat. I have become a better member of society and only occasionally commit arson now. Especially in Melbourne.,5
97,com.despdev.quitzilla,Andy Villa,Very helpful and encouraging,4

100,com.despdev.quitzilla,Ramon Roche,"Like the idea. It's helpful, but could be better & more to it. Maybe add a chat tab to assist & discuss certain struggles with like-minded individuals trying to sustain from the same things. & the full version could be cheaper. Or the free version could have more.",3
101,com.despdev.quitzilla,Chelsea C. (Sea),"Best one I can find and it's still not good enough. Although the paid version is reasonable and the fully available features are nice, I can't even adjust the time properly and it would go to a negative. Why isn't it that simple to add that I broke the chain last night or couple nights ago. It was nice.",2
102,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I've used a few different time counter apps but I like ""bad habits"" because I can track numerous habits, I can see the amt of $ I've saved (a great motivator to keep going) and I do enjoy the daily quotes. The trophy room, rewards shop and 'reason to quit' section are also nice little ""extras"" :-)",5
103,com.despdev.quitzilla,Alli Murphy,"Favorite. App. Period. This app is amazing and lets me track multiple things I'd like to quit at once. Easy to reset when I relapse and add comments, allowing time for reflection and making my next run of being clean from whatever it is, longer. Quitzilla has been the one app that has helped me in my life more than any other so far. Super easy to use in whatever way works best for you.",5
104,com.despdev.quitzilla,Avalre,"Time will tell if I'm able to eliminate my numerous addictions and whether or not this app helps, but for now, it's allowed me to take the first step of scrolling through the list of addictions that they list for the icons and recognize that yes, I have this addiction, and yes, I need to be getting rid of it. Even assisting me in recognizing these things as addictions is enough to rate 5 stars and buy the premium version (THANK YOU for NOT making this a monthly subscription!!!!).",5
105,com.despdev.quitzilla,Samuel Armstrong,Awesome app!! Put off paying for the upgrade for a while but was worth it. What I like most is the calculation of time and money spent or saved...keeps me recording my slip ups and makes it so much more than just a clock. The calendar view is also really cool,5
106,com.despdev.quitzilla,Uriy Bychenko,"Never have I seen such a good app which has motivated me to buy a premium version. It really helps and it's useful, but it would be great to see more updates from the developer's side including more customazible features with a little bit redesigned interface.",4
107,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Simple and efficient. I like that it adds up the money you save from quitting certain habits, and you can choose rewards that you can spend the savings on. Not only that but the full version is very inexpensive and it's a one time fee. Totally worth it!",5
108,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,I love this app. It keeps me sane! It's really good and you only have to pay less than ¬£3 to get the full app forever. It's amazing. It gives you milestones. It gives you daily quotes. It tell you how long you've gone to the second!!!! I woke up this morning and saw that I had gone 24hrs from self harming and it was so rewarding to see a notification tell me how strong I am. This app is perfect and you can tailer it to your needs. Definitely doesn't get enough recognition. Thank you.,5
109,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,Very easy to use and versatile unlike other apps that are only for quitting smoking. Also let's you go back to when you really quit instead of making you use the day you got the app. New inspirational quotes daily along with milestone notifications. Very satisfied so far.,5
110,com.despdev.quitzilla,Morgan Ward,Like it VERY much!! I use it to help control my gambling problem. Every time I get the urge to gamble online or in person I look up this app and it shows how long I've been free of gambling on my screen. Helps me alot to not go gamble in seeing how long I've been gambling free!! I haven't gambled since downloading Quitzilla!!,5
111,com.despdev.quitzilla,Cincin,"This is the best of the quitting habit trackers I've tried. Nice simple yet classy UI, & adding motivational cards helps remember why I'm doing this. I have used it for ages so upgraded to premium for extra goals. I also like the dark theme. The only thing I would have liked in premium was maybe an added diary or notes, though I still think it was well worth my money.",5
112,com.despdev.quitzilla,Vinicius Veiga,"I love this app! I bought a long time ago, but now I have different bad habits, that in sometimes I want to quit for a ""goal time"" less than 24 hours, like 12, 8, 6,4,2,1, etc... Could be interesting if we have other options or a ""custom"" option in this section.",4
113,com.despdev.quitzilla,Alperen Derin,"This app has not been updated and developed for a very long time. I had a backup before. However, notes or other things were not included in the backup. Only the day I left and the addiction names are available!",1
114,com.despdev.quitzilla,Zofia Kaminski,"Loud advertisements! The app is good, but if you want to quietly log a bad habit like nail-biting you might get a loud ad. I don't mind ads, but I wish you could turn the sound off so I'm not trying to turn down my volume in a panic for logging my habit.",4
115,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Really handy tool to recognise patterns in your addictions! Only thing is I wish the trophy room would reset when you 'fail' so you can re-earn your 1 day, 3 day, 1 week etc trophies as I feel this would help you stay more motivated than waiting to a hieve the 3 month one for example. Even if they added a feature where you could manually reset them",4
116,com.despdev.quitzilla,Douglas,"It's accurate as long as you're honest. It does help though. It would be nice if it showed statistics.... maybe it does and I don't know how to use it. Seems pretty simple, But I've been going 3 weeks ,one week, etc. It'd be nice to see a statistical readout of my progress,( obviously in the long term ) LOL.",4
117,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Every time you become a new phone, you have to pay the premium again, although it states clearly ,you only pay once . I used smart switch, it was properly transferred, but the premium is lost. I wrote to Quizilla the last time regarding this,but nothing was done so I paid a second time...im not paying a third time üòï",1
118,com.despdev.quitzilla,Aaron Savage,Pros: It's simple and easy to use Keeps me informed every 24hrs I pass Keeps the timer going until I reset it Actually motivating to see the time since I started and how far I've been able to follow through...that's personally the best part to me. Cons: The only one I can think if atm is you can only put in 2 Quits before having to pay for more to go on your list.,4
119,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Hello Sobriety Team! I bought the premium version because I really liked this app since the first day, now I can say that I stayed away from all my bad habits for loger than never thanks to this app, the think and the point of this is that the most useful part is the Widget, and not the UI, and I woukd like to have the widget more customizable. exple. the widget it still too large in its most reduced version, and it has a big space between the icon and the borders. Could that be reduced? thanks.",4
120,com.despdev.quitzilla,Sam van der Leek,"I think it's a good app to use to track bad habits u want to quit. But the interface is quite minimalistic, only a quote and an overview of your bad habits. (And an add) Maybe try new ideas and put more on the interface.",4
121,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,It's not invasive enough. I caved quickly. It doesn't really help with anything because you never check it. Seeing your clean streak go up doesn't work when you don't actually ever end up checking it. I think it needs progress notifications.,3
122,com.despdev.quitzilla,Natasha Aliasas,"This app has given me great hope to break my bad habits and keep track of my failures and progress. No more having to input dates manually on the calendar! Furthermore, seeing how long I've abstained as soon as I open the app really helps increase my motivation to push onward. Lastly, I really love the quotes!",5
123,com.despdev.quitzilla,Russ Bernhardt,Simple and uncluttered but exactly what I needed to make me more aware of my addictions and bad habits. The calendar and counters to show win steaks is really motivating and helps me hold myself accountable. The widgets are a must to keep those times up front and center to keep me on track. Exactly what I needed!,5
124,com.despdev.quitzilla,Austin Van Tassel,"Great little app. Having the calendar along with a time clock counting the amount of days, hours and minutes since you quit is a helpful visual aid. If your goal is not to quit but to cut back you can still keep track from the day you made your resolution. You simply click on the date that you had a drink or a cigarette, etc. and write a note so that you have a reference point to refer to so as not to lose control. Right now I am quitting drinking for a month with the goal to drink less after.",5
125,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"This is one of my favorite apps. There is no other like it. It shows you your time in a graph manner for you to conceptually see. Sometimes just looking at a clock doesn't help, its good to see the percentage done of the next milestone time.",5
126,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I liked the interface of this app. It's really great for the committed ones to keep track of the habits they want to get rid off (like drinking, gaming, t.v, etc.).

128,com.despdev.quitzilla,SJ Mac,The only issue is that I don't think you can edit how much you spend on habits when you've already set them. Otherwise - great way to track habits you want to stop!,4
129,com.despdev.quitzilla,Rico B,"Downloaded to find out to use a widget they charge $6.99? Incredible swindle is all I can say!! For the simplicity for what app does, not worth it & the widget is crucial to quickly visualize where you are with your sobriety goals. Uninstalled within minutes & just downloaded 1 of the other plenty apps truly dedicated to your sobriety!!",1
130,com.despdev.quitzilla,Zuker Bogs,I only been into this app for about 3 minutes after setting up the addiction part. Then when I went back to home page. BOOM an ad with a lady sucking banana with sexy outfit. Is the ad comes from my own browsing preference? Hope this will be fixed. Anyway seems like a great app. Thanks.,3
131,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,Please make more trophies!!! I think it would make the app a lot better if after one year it had a trophies for every year after that until 10 years where one would receive the ultimate trophie or something like that. The jump from 1 to 5 just sucks,4
132,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"While the app is good, I got a paid version to have the widget on my home screen but I noticed that the widget doesn't update the time by itself and one has to tap on it, open the app and only post that, the time gets updated on the widget. This is quite annoying. Please do resolve this issue.",4
133,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,its very simple and works well for what it is but they could add more to it like good ideas to do with the money stuff that is fun to do that is safe from addiction like plan a trip to the fair or start crafting some people while getting caught in addiction forget what normal things to do and have fun are . just an idea but the app works well for me and the motivation of watching the clock is awesome also breaking points like one week two weeks one month. good app,4
134,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"This is the best quiting app around. The reminders aren't intrusive, but are there, the layout is easy to follow. Great app, it has really improved my life. I bought premium, it is cheap but without a doubt worth it.",5
135,com.despdev.quitzilla,Thejus Parthasarathi,"A great app to track your vices and to stop them(if you want to), but overall why I love this app so much is because of its minimal interface, not like other ones which have too much information on them.

138,com.despdev.quitzilla,Maximiliaan Einerhand,"Very good app, helpfull, easy to use. The only thing i would recommend is to be able to change the money amounts after you filed them in, because the amount of money a habit costs can change. And also maybe dont use icons that trigger peoples addictions, like a cigarette for smoking etc. But neutral icons.

173,com.despdev.quitzilla,Chubington Panda,It's what I needed. It's a timer that lists how long you've quit anything. There's a quote everyday at the top and it's oddly nice in my opinion. This can help anyone who needs a constant reminder that they quit and can help put why into perspective.,4
174,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,would be great to have a weekly / daily backup feature where it overwrites the file in google drive. also would be awesome to back up to internal / external storage as well. AMOLED Dark mode too. good app very helpful with bad habits.,4

If you signed up for the app to have it remove the addiction from your life, I'm not sure if there's an app for that.

281,com.despdev.quitzilla,Frank Fagnano,"I'm quitting smoking, so every little thing helps. The thing I like most about this app is it gives me a breakdown of how much money I am saving by quitting this nasty habit. So far that is one of my biggest motivations, seeing the money that would normally go towards cigarettes in real time. It has been a real eye-opener.",5
282,com.despdev.quitzilla,Danyal Vigil,"This app utilized a very effective method of consolidating checkpoints (1 day, 3 days, weeks months etc) so that you feel that endless fulfillment of reaching short tern goals... which helps to quit bad habits in the end. Incredible app",5
283,com.despdev.quitzilla,Yulia Sokolova,It's pretty basic. Tells you how long you have been abstinent but if you wnat a widget you gotta buy premium. Quotes are annoying and I wish I could turn them off. Overall does what it needs to do.,3
284,com.despdev.quitzilla,J. Caffey,"App from Google on my LG K92 phone (just like the ""I-phone"" but for a lower price). Quitzilla is working great. Upgraded for a one time fee of $4.99, great price for tracking my entire list of things that are out of control !! ‚ù§",5

286,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,Free version let's you count 2 things. It's like a stop watch. Simple for what I need it for. Obviously wont help you quit anything. That's on you. But if you suck at keeping track of time this apps got you covered.,4

Noticed it's split up into 3 categories, habits that basically we're money, time, or just an event that's bad for you and the first example that's listed is ""porn"".

290,com.despdev.quitzilla,Gabe Fox,I only use the feature that shows me how long it has been since I stopped and even that is more than enough of a motivator. I seriously cannot reccomend this enough as I am currently closer to stopping my addiction than I ever have been before.,5
291,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"UPDATE: I posted a previous feedback with one star for purchasing the app, and not getting premium feature. this is a bug, I cleared app cash from settings, and now I have the premium features. the app deserves 4 stars, but honestly this is a very annoying bug, so i will go for 3 stars instead",3
292,com.despdev.quitzilla,Houssam Elbadissi,Amazing app! Simple and to the point. One note however: Dark Mode shouldn't be a paid feature. It's an essential thing that all apps should have by default (follow system).,4
293,com.despdev.quitzilla,Aaron Conner,Great app to track how long youve been sober for. It has been really useful for me regarding big and small habits. The quotes that come everyday are helpful too as well. Ovet all the app is fairly simple to use and I'll be using it for using for however long I need it.,5
294,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Very good app, but something missing there to be perfect...and you can offer this with new product package (I will buy it immediate): - Widget to show habbit name - Wigdet counter to support ""remaining time untill the end"" - Custom period to be possible to be set (X days) - Reminder ""Did you win today with: $habbitname"" - Custom motivational text (set up by user) - Automatic backup to Google or localy - To add more icons (like mobile, food, etc) - Custom start date?",4

296,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,It is an awesome app. Sometimes when I'm about to start my bad habit again I take a look at how long I've been holding myself from the bad habit (4 months+) and that gives me motivation to keep on pushing further.,5
297,com.despdev.quitzilla,Aman,Fraudulent Developer. Beware. I had purchased the premium version but I have still not been provided with premium features. Developer does not respond to mails regarding refund or resolving the issue. Stay away from this app or you will lose your money like me.,1
298,com.despdev.quitzilla,Jeanne Huitt,Just started. Great concept and I'm looking good forward to quitting my bad habit(s). Can you add the ability to develop new good habits like drinking water and exercising?,3

304,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,The app awesome. Paid for the widgets and find them super useful. My only complaint (reason for 4 stars) is it's limited by days/hours/min and doesn't show years or months.,4

309,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,Only downloaded today but so far so good. Nice and simple to use and love the dollar value add up. I was shocked to see how much I spend per month and year. I think that feature alone will help me kick my junk food addiction üòä,4
310,com.despdev.quitzilla,zibusiso siso-sibanda,It has a simple interface and is very clean. Does not take up too much space. After much use I will be giving this app 5 stars because you can write the habit in your own words which I find very useful,5
311,com.despdev.quitzilla,Hazem Wagdy,"Only thing I noticed it's that there is no update since 2020.. I wish devs still supports it, another thing is about widget timer... It doesn't update.. I have to click on it for the time to update the progress, otherwise it shows old values",5
312,com.despdev.quitzilla,Habibul Bashar,Overall App is good but its limited to only 2! So it could be better if you could at least give 3 to 5 options! But the price is also least and for lifetime ! Thanks for that!,3
313,com.despdev.quitzilla,Susan Rehagen,"I love the app, it's really helped me. But I don't like how there's no options for self harm in the choosing the addiction segment. I would like for that to be added as it's a very serious addiction.",4
314,com.despdev.quitzilla,Nicholas Munjodzi (Graylight),"Quite simple and also I like the graphics and orientation of things which makes a motivational vibe to go through hurdles, although why restrict the dark theme if they are only 2 themes available",5
315,com.despdev.quitzilla,Mahmoud Baaqeil,I like the program You know if you stop any bad habit you need to replace it with good habit so if you could add good habit traker if you add some thing like this it will be perfect. I have buy the premium if you could do this I be so happy üòå,4

318,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,This is really helping me break my self destructive habits by not only giving me a goal to reach for but by holding me accountable. Seeing how much money you save by not buying junk food is extremely effective and serves as great motivation. Keep it up!,5

321,com.despdev.quitzilla,Chris Nolan,Your app isn't worth the money. It's petty how you have kept widgets and dark mode under paid. I'm not going to use this app for a long time. The in-app purchase doesn't justify...given that dollar cost more in other countries.,1
322,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"It's a good app, but having to pay for ""unlimited addictions"" is definitely not what you should have to do, and the phrasing of it kind of triggers me. It's like its telling me that I should get more addictions, or that they're good for me. Sorry for the rant, but it's my honest opinion.",3
323,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,I like that you get to change the time to the last time you did your habit...where as other apps just started the timer from when you downloaded the app. I also love that it keeps track of your longest abstinence times and lets you document why you broke the abstinence and starts over your time.,5
324,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Really great and useful. Tracks times and helps keeping motivated. A journal feature would be great, and would definetely bump this review to five stars",4
325,com.despdev.quitzilla,Claire Richards,"I like the idea, I paid so could have widget. Unfortunately the widget isn't keeping time. I need to cluck on it to make it update the time of abstaining. The app itself is simple and great.",4
326,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"i absolutely love this app, better than others and premium is only 2.50 euro! it's very easy to navigate the app and make new addictions you want to overcome because of its simplistic interface. i recommend this app!",5
327,com.despdev.quitzilla,Carolina Mota,"I've been using this app to get rid of some habits and it's actually really helped. Usually I think quotes are cringey, but I actually like these ones because they remind me to not give up. Overall, it's a good way to help get rid of bad habits.",5

330,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,I like the app but it definitely needs more icons and better widgets. The current widget takes to much place and can't be customized in any way.,3
331,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"One time payment for full access, tiered goals that give you something to look forward to, quality inspirational and related quotes on your abstinence dashboard. Having the widget on my homescreen (paid feature) gives me a constant reminder of my goal.",5
332,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I enjoy the app, but I would like to see custom targets. The jump from 1 year to 5 year is very big. Why not allow adding multiple custom targets like for example 1000 days. Also add a counter how much dyas to go until the next target.",3

To back up your data you have to manually do it and save it somewhere so when you redownload the app you have to upload the file.

3466,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"LOUD fullscreen ads within few minutes of usage really made me hate it! I 
bought it, but would not recommend buying it so far. Implementation of dark 
theme is gay, it is actually pink and gray. Premium colors limited to only 
12 basic colors. Currency list is long but it does not contain the one that 
I need (e.g. RSD).",1
3467,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"This is really helpful if you're disciplined enough to hold yourself responsible for mistakes and actually report it to the timer. Very friendly user interface and a decent free 2 habits to start with. When you do fail to resist that bad habit, it reminds you to love yourself as you reset the timer rather than making you feel bad about it (you probably already feel bad anyway). Very gentle, easy to use, would highly recommend.",5
3468,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"App seems to work ok for what I need. Ads are annoying but expected. I 
noticed that if you add a new habit and change the view to anything other 
than 1 day, you can't select 1 day again, 3 day view is then the lowest 
selectable value. This seems like a small oversight in a reasonably good 
app.",4
3469,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Great app for those trying to kick any addiction or bad habit. The 
motivational quotes are a great touch as they can usually be related to my 
own situation and the timer is a great motivator for me...seeing how close 
I am to reaching another milestone helps keep me on track and working 
towards it.",5
3470,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Great for tracking many things, I use it to track my sobriety and it's been 
a tremendous help and a really positive motivator! I am however setting 
goals for myself (ie no drinking for 3 weeks) it would be cool if there was 
a way to implement that in the app. Really great app though!",5
3471,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Pretty decent, no preassure and really promotes self respect will power and the like. Its also subtle with its decency, for eg dosent show he name of the habit when you pass a milestone on the homescreen but still lets you know at good intermittions as to not remind that its a problem too frequently but enought to remind you that your doing a greatjob",5
3472,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"App is well equipped for battling bad habits. Consider adding more 
achievements like 25 Days 50, 75, 90 Days, 5 and 10 weeks. It would be 
great if the achievement badges are shown on the dashboard. It would be 
cool if user can set a personalized achievement like 22 days .. etc for 
each addiction.",5
3473,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Good job to the developer for this amazing app. Really helpful & has a great motivating quotes. It would be perfect if this app has more icons because there still a lot of bad habits we do. Also, add options about how much money wasted (Daily not just weekly), time spent (Minutes) and quantity of consumption. Keep it up! Thank you very much",5
3474,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I use the app to track my soda intake. I am trying to end my one a day can of soda. I know it doesn't seem like much, but this app really helps me feel better when I'm seeing that I've made it to 10 days without a soda. The more days that I have tacked on makes me want to hold on to them more. The app is very easy to set up. I have not had any issues. It is always Dependable.",5
3475,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"As I'm just starting to quit alcohol, which is easier said than done, this helps a lot by helping me to see how many times I drink and how much money I've been spending. Just these two aspects alone are helping me to see the bigger picture and I actually have cut back, although I still a ways to go. Thank you developer(s)!",4
3476,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I have never paid for an app and I have never written a review for an app, but I have to say that this is by far the best app on the market. An app that actually promotes personal health and development, let alone the way the app is made. I have been wanting to make an app like this for a long time and now that I have found this app, I couldn't be more happy. Thank you so much for helping me change my life.",5
3477,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"For people who find visuals for their progress helpful, this is a great app. The pleasant, clean design of the UI makes it very nice to use, and the motivational quotes give me something to ponder in the early morning. If I could change anything about this app it would be that I wish the timers didn't seem to pulsate as the seconds tick by, as I find it nauseating if I look at it for too long. Overall, very helpful!",4
3478,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I really love this app and what it stands for. Simple, sleek and efficient. It won't help people who don't want to help themselves, but it's the perfect tool to track your days of sobriety from your addictions, and to stay motivated by the quotes. A one-time small fee is worth it to keep many sobriety days in check!",5
3479,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"This is a helpful app but I would like to be able set shorter goals.  Like daily or even hourly goals. For me sometime looking a 3 day or 2 month goals seems so far away. But being able to say ""I just need to may it through this hour"" and then celebrate making it through that hour. That would be helpful for me.",5
3480,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Great app that lets you track your progress of quitting various items. I 
love that it lists several different things that one could be addicted to, 
not just drugs. Also love the daily quotes and the way it sets achievable 
goals and displays your progress. Very handy and rewarding app.",5
3481,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"This app has been exactly every I was looking for. It's simple to use, and ready to keep track of any slip ups. Plus, I love the quote of the day. Worth the price to get the premium version though, the ads in the free version were particularly annoying.",5
3482,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I really love this app and what it's doing. Overall it really is a good app 
that helps and will help a lot of people dealing with serious issues. I 
absolutely love the daily quotes as well. My one complaint is that it costs 
money to have more than two addictions. I am fine with an app charging 
money or having a premium subscription - however, I do not think its right 
to require that of people dealing with multiple serious issues. I am fine 
with the other premium features continuing to cost money, but this one is 
different. Personally, for instance, I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and 
thus have quite a few problems to meddle through. Gambling, porn, spending 
friviously, and others that I'd love to track but partly because of those 
addictions I can not afford premium. Perhaps put in more ads to cover the 
cost of free users and have premium remove those ads as well? Still, I 
appreciate what the developers created and it is still wonderful and will 
help many people, and besides that one complaint it is a perfect 
and,wonderfully programmed app. Thank you.",4
3483,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"As a food addict and someone who was developing a problem with alcohol, I 
finally decided to download a sobriety app to help keep myself accountable. 
The basic version is great but loves, please pay for the upgrade- the 
features are amazing and having the widget on my homescreen is so helpful! 
The daily quotes are also awesome for focus and meditation!",5
3484,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"The best app I have ever used to control my gambling. I decided to stop 
drinking soda at the same time...the trophies and percentage of goal 
counter is extremely motivating...a kind of ""don't break the chain"" 
approach. The seconds of your life ticking is also a strong feature. Love 
this app!",5
3485,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"i use this app to track my self harm. its help me so much without me even 
realizing it. every time i have an urge i just look bad and think of how 
far ive gone and how much time would be wasted if i relapse. as of right 
now ive gone 28 days and 1 hour!!! almost to a month!! i love the 
inspirational quotes and waking up to them. 10/10 would recommend getting 
if you're trying to stop an addiction.",5
3486,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Great app to keep track of time and money saved when kicking a habit. Can also keep track of multiple addictions for those quitting more than one. Easy to input and keep track of times when you relapse, does not make you feel guilty about it, and you can begin to see a pattern when you look back at it. Very helpful.",5
3487,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Really like the features of this app - great job devs! But I wish I could configure it to be more ""in my face"" so that I'd get timely reminders to abstain from my snacking habit when I need them more! Really wish I could tell the app to remind me at night (when my snacking urge kicks in usually) to not break my streak, to save the money for rewards, or just surface my own ""Reasons to Quit"" as a notification to me at a configurable time. Hell, even the ability to configure a time for the daily motivational quote would be useful.",4
3488,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I love this app. However the ads about the dating and stuff I kind of 
inappropriate for people who are trying to overcome sex / porn addiction. 
They trigger relapse. Thanks for reading.",5
3489,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"It worked when I first set it up, then stopped loading any features except 
the daily quote and timer. Annoyed as I hoped it would work as promised. 
Nice idea, but a lot more basic than it lets on. I am uninstalling now. 
Might as well install one of many other apps that offer just a timer but 
with more features.",2
3490,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I am extremely grateful for this app. The one thing I would like to change, if possible,  is when entering notes on the calendar that it doesn't reset your timer. I wanted to use it as a personal note regarding my addiction rather than a means of confirming relapsing and resetting time. Again, thank you so much for this app. It really helps in my case..",5
3491,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"It is awesome app. Grateful to use this app especially the pro version 
really help motivate you to break free from bad habit. Unlike other app , 
This app really motivate you with progress",5

3493,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I like the quotes a lot! Seeing the time I've been without a habit is 
great! My only qualm is that non-Premium members get so little out of it. 
I'd like non-Premium users to have access to more than just my sobriety 
timer and quote of the day.",4
3494,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"The pictures I the review of the app are very deceiving. The actual app 
only has the option of adding an addiction and that's it. All other 
features are not availbe unless you download the premium version.",1
3495,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I can note a variety of different things. For example, I quit alcohol and drugs on July 4th, 1994, but quit smoking on December 6th, 1994. I can track both of these successes with this app. I really like the way this app displays that information. It's very convenient.",5
3496,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Honestly got this app to jus follow bad habits... Didn't think too much of 
it.. But when comparing it to other habit trackers it's soo much better. 
Like you genuinely see how long you can go without the bad habit. Counts to 
the minute in when you relapsed so you're not left assuming how long it's 
been, you know exactly how long it has been. Could do with extra features 
but I'm not creative enough to supply some thoughts.",5
3497,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"This app has already helped me a lot, and I've only had it for a short 
while. It does have quite a few ads, but that's understandable. I 
personally think the ads are worth it, because this app is very well made 
and encouraging.",4
3498,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Very good app helps to keep track of progress on bad habits. It's very 
motivating for me to see the trophies I've been awarded and keeps me 
going.I also love the fact it let's you list reasons why you want to stop 
your bad habit because I use it in my time of need and it helps me to not 
relapse.",5
3499,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Good app with fairly comprehensive functionality including relapse statistics, motivational quotes, and a visually appealing interface. Quite like the app, as it helps me looks back and see how far I've come already with bad habits. Would recommend!",5

3984,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,Really encouraging.  Would recommend.  I like the daily quotes and visuals.,5
3985,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,The idea is good and a very clean UI.,4
3986,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"It's one of the better ones I have seen, and comfortable to use, it just needs to be, as many others also, more customisable. I should be able to set a goal. For exactly the time to the day I wish to achieve it. To be able to set something over a weeks period, i.e ""I want to stop eating meat at least 4 days a week"" and have reminders that tell me how many days I have achieved it and how many I have 'allowed' to eat meat.",3
3987,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Great app! But, the free version needs more features, given that we are generating ad revenue. At least let us track more than two bad habits, change colours and use one of the two widgets. Then I will definitely recommend this app to others and even consider buying premium.",3
3988,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Have been using the app for a couple of months now. I would have described it as extremely useful, if not for one very simple flaw.  The encouraging progress notifications should be one of the app's most powerful features, except that there is no option to turn off the notification sound, or change the sound. This means that either I have to disable the notifications altogether, or I have to let the app make the same sound as my sms alert.   I'm writing this review at 4:20am because the app just woke me up at 4am, with what I thought was an important sms alert.  Other than this one feature the app is fine. However I feel that the notifications are an important part of how the app works to change habits, and this feature is currently set up in an intrusive way that makes it unusable for me.",3
3989,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Good,smooth interface. Please add a button to the widget to reset timer without going into app. Also please add graph showing frequency of timer resets over time. I think it helps show progression. Only started using the app today so maybe there is one I haven't found",3
3990,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I like the tracker. I'm glad they did an update to allow $0 inputs for money spent on the addiction.   What's missing still is an option to change the addiction between money, time, and event post-creation. As it stands now, the only time you can specify the type is upon initial creation of the addiction tracker.",4
3991,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Really nice, clean, well built app. Really enjoying the update as well, before I couldn't set a quit date into the future but it's changed with the update. No annoying ads is also a huge bonus. 5/5",5
3992,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"UPDATE: I guess you can still log a setback without having to use a dollar figure. Unfortunately, previous goals have to be re-created/re-entered ‚Äì slight inconvenience. Set up a new goal and choose either time based or event based.  It would be great if you could just edit a pre-existing goal and change the type.  My original critique: Why does a setback (calendar log) now need to have a $ amount? There are plenty of addictions that don't require the spending of money?",4
3993,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,I like seeing how long I've been abstaining and how long I have to go to hit certain time mile stones. It's very motivating.,5

3997,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,Limited without Premium. Can't access any of the features seen in the 'read more' blurbs and screenshots above. Must be only for Premium.

I upgraded to premium right away so I could add more habits, definitely worth the low (one time) fee. I like keeping track of the money spent and also noting the reasons I quit the bad habit. I need to check out the other features but this is the best habit tracker I've tried so far.",5
4029,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,Great app. I've quit smoking for over 4 months and sugar for over 2 weeks. One of my motivations is that I don't want to reset that timer and see just a few hours.  I never thought that I'll quit any of those bad habits and takes a lot of willpower. The app is the small help needed to stay away from those,5
4030,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I really like. Its simple but does the job. I like the little motivation quotes :) It would be cool if during the setup or on settings it would ask the ""regular time of the day for a drink"" and then each day during that time frame it would drop some more motivation quotes or bring some of the notes of why you quit X up. And add more achievements, I love my trophies :)  Thank you!",5
4031,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I like the app. For some items that doesnt require monetary value, I just use my time =money attitude. Like trading income for wasting time on something. To reset counter fo a relapse into some addictive behavior was tricky. But I like that it count up to the second. And I like the thoughts you put under the wheel to make me think of overcoming challenges ""I can overcome anything""l) instead of how bad I feel about not being successful in a previous attempt. Please consider more customisations and at least 3 items under the free version instead of only 2.",5
4032,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"I am using this app to help quit some bad habits and it has been really helpful. I'm able to nail down almost to the second when the last time I had something was. It's been really beneficial to see that and keep the streak going. I paid for the full version so I can change the colors to better differentiate, plus it's fun.   While the app has so far been great, I really wish there were more icon choices. Like a soda bottle or candy bar or potato chip. The more icons that are available the better. For someone who is quitting specific things I'd like to be able to attach an accurate picture/icon to it.",5
4033,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"While I love the app and in the end even became premium. The only thing that's bothering me is that the app glitches when adding more than 7 bad habits. Please fix it.  Also, adding a couple of extra icons wouldn't be bad.",4

4035,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,Like this simple but motivating app. The only thing I would change is for 'money saved' to show as the total saved since your quit date - rather than since timer reset - minus any money spent on the habit in that time. That would make it perfect for me.,5
4036,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"It does exactly what it says on the tin. Create a thing you want to track, it tracks and reminds you. No nonsense.",4
4037,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,Just the right amount of motivation. It's not in your face but gives you a gentle tap on your shoulder to remind you of what you are trying to achieve and how far you have come.,5
4038,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Simple and elegant. It's got the counter I need so I never have to think about days, and a few good quotes to start my mornings off, but ultimately keeps the responsibility where it belongs: in my hands.",5
4039,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,"Good, it has potential. I bought premium to help myself with some habits I'm not proud of (procrastination being the leading thing). However, the interface is rather basic, and there's room for more features. Android Wear support will also be welcome.",4

I also note someone else here has said that the timer doesn't keep ticking in the widget and sticks at what it was when you add it. If that's the case,it's no use for me anyway. A ""help"" section might be a good idea so I can try the widget :)",3

4049,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,Paid for the premium and I think $2.99 for life is a but much. It should be $0.99. The app is just what you need to track the progress of multiple habits at the same time.,4

4178,com.despdev.quitzilla,A Google user,Serves its purpose and it's great for a couple bucks! I changed my rating to 5 stars because it's up to me to change  or stop a bad habit and I genuinely appreciate the additional resource I HAVE  CHOSEN to assist me. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the daily quotes and the consistent reminder that I am solely accountable for breaking my own perceived bad habits. Developers need the cash to maintain apps we appreciate and use regularly. It was a small price to pay and way cheaper than some of my habits.

However if I can make a suggestion, I saw a video on youtube on how to help yourself stop a bad habbit, in fact, that's what inspired me to find an app that can keep me on track. One suggestion on that video is to look at your bad habbit when it comes amd examine it; try to see what it taste like or what it feels like. They stated that it would help if you were aware of what you are doing or taking. So maybe it would be nice if we can have some sort of journal that we can write on.",5
